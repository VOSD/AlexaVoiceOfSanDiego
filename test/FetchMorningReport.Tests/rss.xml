				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re taking a closer look at the list of San Diego schools that are slated to <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/education/the-20-schools-in-san-diego-unified-facing-the-most-teacher-layoffs/"  target="_blank">lose the highest percentages of teachers to layoffs</a>.</p>
<p>As our Mario Koran reports, &#8220;the highest concentration of layoffs are in southeastern San Diego neighborhoods, one of the most economically disadvantaged areas of town. At Fulton K-8 in Encanto, where roughly 90 percent of students qualify for subsidized lunch, more than half the school’s teachers are facing layoffs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Why is this? &#8220;Because teachers are placed in schools based on seniority, the more senior teachers generally seek more affluent schools with better test scores, and poorer schools see more layoffs.&#8221;</p>
<p>We put the 20, the percent of educators they may lose and their poverty percentages into <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C8Cma-6VQAERQsi.jpg:large"  target="_blank"  >one jarring graphic</a>.</p>
<p>Many teachers will not end up being laid off. The district will replace the ones who are with more senior teachers from other schools. The disruption can be awful for schools trying to build community and rapport between principals and educators.</p>
<h2>Legal Marijuana Tool Against Illegal Shops</h2>
<p>Cities like San Diego have devoted plenty of manpower to shutting down illegal marijuana dispensaries. But now, some are discovering that a solution has been lurking within them all along: Allow more legal pot shops.</p>
<p>As our Maya Srikrishnan reports, &#8220;the most effective way to crack down on illegal dispensaries <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/land-use/the-best-way-to-crack-down-on-illegal-dispensaries-accommodate-legal-ones/"  target="_blank">might be to help legal marijuana businesses thrive</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>The little city of Lemon Grove is about to test this approach. Voters approved allowing the storefronts. Now, the city will have to make room for them. As the industry becomes more mainstream, the thinking goes, buyers will prefer the better quality at the legal shops.</p>
<h2>GOP Touts Faulconer as No Sanctuary Supporter, But &#8230;</h2>
<p>Speaking of graphics, the San Diego County Republican Party <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SanDiegoRepublicans/photos/a.10150106832125136.393544.489200505135/10158253104700136/?type=3&amp;permPage=1"  target="_blank"  >posted one on Facebook</a> touting San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer&#8217;s declaration that San Diego is not a sanctuary city.</p>
<p>It came after Attorney General Jeff Sessions <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/video/sessions-to-sanctuary-cities-comply-with-laws-or-lose-federal-grants-907491395846"  target="_blank"  >warning</a> to cities that they cooperate with immigration enforcement or pay a price.</p>
<p>The post generated hundreds of comments, including some from people who seem to believe that all Latinos are unauthorized immigrants.</p>
<p>Faulconer can say San Diego isn&#8217;t a sanctuary city because, <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/border/neither-san-diego-nor-california-is-a-sanctuary-for-the-undocumented/" >as we explored</a>, the term has no meaning. San Diego has similar policies as proud sanctuary cities. The mayor even recently <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C6_uT4WVoAAWFKk.jpg"  target="_blank"   data-rel="lightbox-0" data-imagelightbox="0" title="">took the step</a> of assuring the City Council he would not let San Diego police be deputized by federal authorities to enforce immigration laws.</p>
<p>All that makes San Diego look like a supposed sanctuary city. However, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers are present in local jails and booking facilities. And an ICE official told me the agency has a strong relationship with local law enforcement.</p>
<p>Sessions cited only one law he is demanding cities comply with: 8 USC 1373, which merely prohibits local law enforcement from restricting the sharing of immigration status with federal officers. It&#8217;s hard to see how any city does not comply with that.</p>
<p><em>&#8211; Scott Lewis</em></p>
<h2>U-T Hammers SoccerCity Petitioners</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;ve bought groceries in San Diego lately, chances are good that you&#8217;ve come across a petition gatherer urging you to support a soccer stadium in our fair city. Stadium boosters need to collect more than 71,000 signatures within a few months in order to force the City Council to approve the SoccerCity development or put it before voters.</p>
<p>The pitch may seem pretty simple. But when the U-T talked to petition gatherers, it found that <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sports/chargers/sd-me-soccercity-20170327-story.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >many were spouting nonsense and lies</a>.</p>
<p>Among the misinformation, according to the U-T: &#8220;It’s a soccer project. But the massive development that accompanies it is either downplayed or denied.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Sea-Level Rise on the Mind</h2>
<p>KPBS summarizes the findings of a new report: &#8220;More than half of Southern California&#8217;s beaches <a href="http://www.kpbs.org/news/2017/mar/28/study-predicts-significant-southern-california-bea/"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >could completely erode back to coastal infrastructure or sea cliffs</a> by the year 2100 as the sea level rises.&#8221;</p>
<p>As we&#8217;ve reported, <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/science-environment/imperial-beach-braces-for-sea-level-rise/"  target="_blank">the mayor of Imperial Beach is worried</a> about &#8220;rising sea levels that could eventually impact 30 percent of the city’s properties, 40 percent of its roads, an elementary school and more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Imperial Beach and La Jolla Shores would be the most threatened of local beaches, the report believes.</p>
<h2>Heaven&#8217;s Gate Is Neither Gone Nor Forgotten</h2>
<p>This month marks the 20th anniversary of the Heaven&#8217;s Gate mass suicide. The mansion where it happened is gone, and a whole generation has grown up without remembering the shock of first hearing about a cult&#8217;s horrific end in Rancho Santa Fe. But the original Heaven&#8217;s Gate website remains online, a time capsule into the time of GeoCities and AOL.</p>
<p>A few years ago, the website Gizmodo explored <a href="http://gizmodo.com/the-online-legacy-of-a-suicide-cult-and-the-webmasters-1617403237"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >the cult&#8217;s unusual cyber-afterlife</a>. The story, which is worth another visit, begins this way: &#8220;Every month, the bills get paid on time. The emails get answered, and any orders filled. Which, for HeavensGate.com, is positively extraordinary. &#8221;</p>
<p>A couple Heaven&#8217;s Gate believers were still running the site as of 2014: &#8220;They refer to themselves simply as &#8216;Telah&#8217; and &#8216;we.'&#8221;</p>
<h2>Culture Report: South of the 8, on Stage</h2>
<p>This week&#8217;s <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/arts/culture-report-22/"  target="_blank">VOSD Culture Report</a> leads off with a look at &#8220;South of the 8,&#8221; a spoken-word performance by residents of the often-neglected southeastern San Diego neighborhoods. It&#8217;s part of an effort by the La Jolla Playhouse to reach beyond its usual audience.</p>
<p>Also in the Culture Report: A local filmmaker dies of cancer at the age of 29, a blogger puts Lyft drivers in the spotlight, and a new restaurant devotes all its profits to charity.</p>
<h2>Quick News Hits: Getting a Leg Up on Humanity</h2>
<p>• A committee of the San Diego Association of Governments is <a href="http://www.kpbs.org/news/2017/mar/28/seven-firms-competing-sandag-investigation-contrac/"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >looking at seven firms</a> that want to investigate the coalition of local government agencies over <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/government/omg-wtf-sandag-knew-its-forecasts-were-wrong-went-to-voters-with-false-promise-anyway-emails-show/"  target="_blank">the transit tax scandal that we uncovered</a>, KPBS reports. It&#8217;s not clear which firms are involved.</p>
<p>• The Washington Post has some <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/03/28/spiders-could-theoretically-eat-every-human-on-earth-in-one-year/?utm_term=.a9dc763e943d"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >disturbing news about spiders</a>: Annually, they &#8220;eat at least as much meat as all 7 billion humans on the planet combined.&#8221; And each year, they eat more than the equivalent of the weight of all 7 billion humans on the planet.</p>
<p>If the spiders rise up, we should be OK in San Diego, right? Sure, we have spiders around, and the county health folks <a href="http://www.sandiegocounty.gov/deh/pests/spiders.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >warn us</a> about the poisonous Black Widow, Brown Widow and Desert Recluse. But how many species can there be here, really?</p>
<p>Try 54 kinds of spider — <i>in just one place</i>. That&#8217;s the word from <a href="http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.3956/2009-23a.1"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >a 2010 report about spiders hanging out at the Cabrillo National Monument</a>. To make local matters more unfriendly for aracnophobes, the San Diego Zoo has its very own <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/03/28/spiders-could-theoretically-eat-every-human-on-earth-in-one-year/?utm_term=.a9dc763e943d"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >Arachnid Rescue Center</a> that&#8217;s full of tarantulas in distress, all the victims of wildlife trafficking.</p>
<p>Eek! I&#8217;m gonna head into my bedroom closet to protect myself from the Arachnoid Apocalypse. No spider will find me h&#8230; uh oh.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 2013, 26-year-old Robert Lubsen killed himself in a Vista jail. This month, the Citizens’ Law Enforcement Review Board, an independent body tasked with investigating deaths at county detention facility, got around to reviewing whether sheriff’s deputies were at fault for failing to place Lubsenon suicide watch.</p>
<p>Despite ligature marks on his neck from a previous suicide attempt, CLERB determined they weren’t at fault.</p>
<p>The suicide was the second oldest cast in CLERB’s backlog of inmate deaths requiring independent review. As <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/public-safety/two-men-at-obvious-risk-of-suicide-two-deaths-and-investigators-just-cleared-both-cases/" >Kelly Davis recounts in a new story</a>, that backlog has grown substantially in recent years, and there are now 46 open death investigations. That&#8217;s the most in CLERB’s 25-year history.</p>
<p>Lubsen’s family sued the county and settled in 2014, receiving assurances from Sheriff Bill Gore that it was changing protocol to make sure signs like Lubsen’s weren’t missed again. But then Jason Nishimoto hung himself in a Vista jail in 2015 despite being previously diagnosed as schizophrenic with a history of suicide attempts.</p>
<p>CLERB likewise found no evidence of fault for sheriff’s deputies in his case either.</p>
<h2>SDSU: Scratch That; We Need Land Soon, Not in 30 Years</h2>
<p>During a panel discussion last week, an SDSU vice president made a <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/land-use/sdsu-reveals-it-doesnt-need-qualcomm-stadium-land-yet/" >noteworthy statement</a>: the university needs the land at the site of Qualcomm Stadium for expansion, but not for 30 to 50 years. The university would build on the land at first with a for-profit developer. The push now for some of the land is more about securing the university’s long-term needs, he said.</p>
<p>Developers behind the SoccerCity proposal seized on it as a major admission.</p>
<p>As our Scott Lewis writes in <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/land-use/sdsu-wait-we-do-need-mission-valley-land-in-near-term/" >a new post</a>, Schulz followed up this weekend with a statement that the university actually does need the land in the more immediate future.</p>
<h2>San Diego Grapples With Trump’s Mexico Fight</h2>
<p>President Donald Trump’s promise to build a bigger and better border wall, pass a border tax and renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement has introduced a bit of turmoil to San Diego and Tijuana’s cozy relationship.</p>
<p>Leaders of the border cities, including San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer flew to Mexico City Monday to tout their efforts at cross-border collaboration, <a href="http://www.kpbs.org/news/2017/mar/27/san-diego-and-tijuana-leaders-push-regional-issues/"  target="_blank"  >as KPBS reported</a>.</p>
<p>“Obviously, there’s a conversation at the national level – it’s important for us as local leaders to talk about what’s working on the local level and the fact that we have such strong ties,” Faulconer told KPBS.</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> Meanwhile, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced Monday that federal grant money wouldn’t be available to jurisdictions that don’t follow a specific provision of federal immigration law.</p>
<p>It’s aimed at discouraging so-called sanctuary cities, an oft-used term that doesn’t actually have a very clear meaning at all, <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/border/neither-san-diego-nor-california-is-a-sanctuary-for-the-undocumented/" >as we covered last month</a>. A representative of Immigration and Customs Enforcement said that agency has a very good relationship with local law enforcement.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/immigration/sd-me-sessions-sanctuary-20170327-story.html"  target="_blank"  >The Union-Tribune dug into Sessions’ pronouncement</a>, finding that officials for both the city and county of San Diego say both jurisdictions would continue to be eligible for federal funds, despite the fact that they both appear on lists of sanctuary cities. Overall, jurisdictions within San Diego County received some $10.6 million from the Department of Justice last year.</p>
<p><strong>• </strong>And in Mexico, increased hostility from the Trump administration is making leaders wary about how much they’ve come to rely on natural gas from the United States, according to a <a href="http://www.kpbs.org/news/2017/mar/27/us-natural-gas-mexico-skyrockets-making-some-mexic/"  target="_blank"  >new story from inewsource</a>.</p>
<p>Natural gas exports to Mexico have increased 300 percent since 2010, and the country now gets 60 percent of all its natural gas from this country. Now, officials in Mexico are considered what alternatives they have to being so dependent on a country that has adopted an especially harsh tone of late.</p>
<h2>We Feel Your Pain, Oakland</h2>
<p>For the third time in 15 months, the NFL owners have approved the relocation of one of the league’s 32 franchises.</p>
<p>This time it’s the Oakland Raiders, who in 2020 will call Las Vegas their home.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2017/03/27/las-vegas-raiders-oakland-los-angeles-san-diego-st-louis-rams-chargers/99701878/"  target="_blank"  >USA Today used the relocation to take a look at what’s next</a> for St. Louis, San Diego and Oakland. In recent decades, cities that lost NFL teams inevitably got a new one, after they ponied up more public money to the league than they offered before the relocation.</p>
<p>Now, though, it’s unclear cities will take that route, with both St Louis and San Diego looking to soccer and the MLS to fill the gap.</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> The move <a href="https://twitter.com/markkersey/status/846446088290734081"  target="_blank"  >provoked</a> San Diego City Councilman Mark Kersey to ask congressional representatives to introduce a bill challenging the NFL&#8217;s anti-trust exemption. The NFL is allowed to act as a monopoly, which is very beneficial when it negotiates broadcast rights.</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> Oakland&#8217;s mayor <a href="https://t.co/b7B6zrI2Qw"  target="_blank"  >defiantly championed</a> her decision not to support public investment in a new football stadium.</p>
<h2>In Other News</h2>
<p><strong>• </strong>The New York Times reports that two little fault zones underneath San Diego <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/27/science/earthquake-fault-line-southern-california.html?smid=tw-nytimesscience&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;_r=0"  target="_blank"  >are actually one big one</a> that could produce an until-now unimagined, catastrophic earthquake. However: &#8220;Over all, the fault moves and accumulates stress at less than one-tenth the rate of the nearby San Andreas fault, meaning it is not likely to rupture,&#8221; said one of the researchers who made the finding.</p>
<p><strong>• </strong>Doug Applegate narrowly lost a challenge to longtime Vista-based Rep. Darrell Issa last year. He’s now facing questions over his campaign spending and just submitted a series of amendments that account for $370,000 in newly reported spending and other adjustments. (<a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/watchdog/sd-me-applegate-filing-20170327-story.html"  target="_blank"  >San Diego Union-Tribune</a>)</p>
<p><strong>• </strong>These bros have a righteous cause. If city leaders in San Clemente don’t accommodate them, those leaders should <a href="http://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/03/two-surfer-bros-plead-with-city-council-to-build-a-12-foot-paul-walker-statue"  target="_blank"  >provide</a> a full accounting to the public of what it is they have against a 12-foot Paul Walker statue. (<a href="http://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/03/two-surfer-bros-plead-with-city-council-to-build-a-12-foot-paul-walker-statue"  target="_blank"  >USA Today</a>)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When the founders of the Jacobs Center for Neighborhood Innovation started the organization in southeastern San Diego many years ago, the vision was to develop dozens of acres of land into community assets and to create a nonprofit to boost other community efforts. There was another piece of the mission that was more unique: Eventually, the leaders of the Jacobs Center would hand the whole thing off, and the community would take over.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not working out as planned: Development has lagged, <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/nonprofits/jacobs-center-southeastern-sd-landholder-sheds-key-staff-in-upheaval/" >the nonprofit is facing deep cuts and debt</a>. And, as Lisa Halverstadt reports in a new story, <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/nonprofits/jacobs-center-uncertain-how-to-end-itself-as-promised/" >there&#8217;s no real plan in place to hand off the efforts to the community as planned</a>.</p>
<p>At one point, the Jacobs family planned to bankroll efforts through 2020. That got pushed back until 2030. Now, the Jacobs Center says it&#8217;s still committed to eventually letting the community take the reins, but how and when it&#8217;ll get there is uncertain.</p>
<p>&#8220;(CEO Reginald) Jones, and Andrew Hapke, a Jacobs family member who serves on the nonprofit’s board, said they’re committed to handing all of the assets over to the community,&#8221; Halverstadt writes. &#8220;They plan to work with residents to lay out a definitive timeline and next steps in coming months. For now, they say the timeline for the Jacobs’ sunset rests heavily on when the Jacobs Center can push forward more development.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Students at Poor Schools Are Taking it From All Sides</h2>
<p>As Mario Koran has reported over the last couple weeks, <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/education/district-schools-facing-layoffs-overwhelmingly-poor/"  target="_blank">the poorest schools in the district are on track to absorb most of the blow</a> from the district&#8217;s multimillion-dollar budget cuts.</p>
<p>Disparate news stories that have trickled out over the last few days tell quite a story of what it&#8217;s like to go to school in a disadvantaged area.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/public-safety/sd-me-man-dead-gompers-20170324-story.html"  target="_blank"  >A man&#8217;s body was found outside of Gompers Preparatory Academy</a> on Friday, the second death in that area in just hours. Last year, parents told Koran that they send their kids to charters like Gompers in southeastern San Diego <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/education/in-search-of-safe-harbor-parents-look-beyond-neighborhood-schools/"  target="_blank">precisely because they think they&#8217;ll be more safe there</a> than at traditional district schools. Schools in southeastern San Diego have been <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/public-safety/sd-me-lockdown-gun-20170215-story.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >put on lockdown</a> numerous times in the last few months <a href="http://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/After-Reports-of-Shots-Fired-OFarrell-Charter-School-Put-on-Lockdown-412624753.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >over violent incidents nearby</a>.</p>
<p>On top of violence and teacher layoffs, students in southeastern San Diego also face environmental issues. Officials discovered lead in the water at the shared campus of Emerson-Bandini and the San Diego Co-operative Charter School. Lead testing across San Diego Unified schools will begin &#8220;at the southeast corner of the district where some of the oldest district schools are located,&#8221; <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/education/sd-me-unified-water-20170323-story.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >reports the Union-Tribune</a>.</p>
<h2>The Heat Turns Up on Hunter, Issa</h2>
<p>Rep. Duncan Hunter is in trouble over his misuse of campaign funds for personal expenses, something he has attributed to mistakes and mix-ups.</p>
<p>Though he&#8217;s been facing heat from the Union-Tribune&#8217;s relentless reporting on the issue, Hunter is now also the subject of two different investigations over his spending. One is from the House Committee on Ethics, the other is from the Justice Department. The Justice Department last week told the House committee to stand down until its probe is complete. <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/watchdog/sd-me-hunter-folo-20170324-story.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >That move, reports, the Union-Tribune, indicates things are serious</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Political law experts say it’s rare for the Justice Department to ask the Ethics Committee to hold off on its own investigation. In recent instances, some lawmakers have ended up behind bars,&#8221; according to the paper.</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> Since Rep. Darrell Issa narrowly eked out a victory in November, he&#8217;s been striking <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/politics/sd-me-politicalnb-0319-story.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >a much more moderate tone</a>. Still, <a href="http://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/Ads-to-Thank-Darrell-Issa-for-Replacing-Obamacare-Air-After-Bill-Pulled--417101213.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >an ad that ran this weekend might have showed the congressman&#8217;s hand</a>: It thanked Issa for his vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act, even though House Republicans pulled their repeal bill on Friday without a vote.</p>
<p>Attorney Mike Levin, a Democrat who is challenging Issa in 2018, appeared on MSNBC on Saturday, where he <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/am-joy"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >said that Issa&#8217;s softened tone hasn&#8217;t come with a change in actual votes</a> or outlook on policies: &#8220;When you look at how he actually votes, he has been in lockstep with Trump every step of the way. &#8230; There isn&#8217;t a single piece of legislation where he has not supported the Trump position.&#8221;</p>
