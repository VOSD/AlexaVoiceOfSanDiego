				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re taking a closer look at the list of San Diego schools that are slated to <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/education/the-20-schools-in-san-diego-unified-facing-the-most-teacher-layoffs/"  target="_blank">lose the highest percentages of teachers to layoffs</a>.</p>
<p>As our Mario Koran reports, &#8220;the highest concentration of layoffs are in southeastern San Diego neighborhoods, one of the most economically disadvantaged areas of town. At Fulton K-8 in Encanto, where roughly 90 percent of students qualify for subsidized lunch, more than half the school’s teachers are facing layoffs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Why is this? &#8220;Because teachers are placed in schools based on seniority, the more senior teachers generally seek more affluent schools with better test scores, and poorer schools see more layoffs.&#8221;</p>
<p>We put the 20, the percent of educators they may lose and their poverty percentages into <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C8Cma-6VQAERQsi.jpg:large"  target="_blank"  >one jarring graphic</a>.</p>
<p>Many teachers will not end up being laid off. The district will replace the ones who are with more senior teachers from other schools. The disruption can be awful for schools trying to build community and rapport between principals and educators.</p>
<h2>Legal Marijuana Tool Against Illegal Shops</h2>
<p>Cities like San Diego have devoted plenty of manpower to shutting down illegal marijuana dispensaries. But now, some are discovering that a solution has been lurking within them all along: Allow more legal pot shops.</p>
<p>As our Maya Srikrishnan reports, &#8220;the most effective way to crack down on illegal dispensaries <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/land-use/the-best-way-to-crack-down-on-illegal-dispensaries-accommodate-legal-ones/"  target="_blank">might be to help legal marijuana businesses thrive</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>The little city of Lemon Grove is about to test this approach. Voters approved allowing the storefronts. Now, the city will have to make room for them. As the industry becomes more mainstream, the thinking goes, buyers will prefer the better quality at the legal shops.</p>
<h2>GOP Touts Faulconer as No Sanctuary Supporter, But &#8230;</h2>
<p>Speaking of graphics, the San Diego County Republican Party <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SanDiegoRepublicans/photos/a.10150106832125136.393544.489200505135/10158253104700136/?type=3&amp;permPage=1"  target="_blank"  >posted one on Facebook</a> touting San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer&#8217;s declaration that San Diego is not a sanctuary city.</p>
<p>It came after Attorney General Jeff Sessions <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/video/sessions-to-sanctuary-cities-comply-with-laws-or-lose-federal-grants-907491395846"  target="_blank"  >warning</a> to cities that they cooperate with immigration enforcement or pay a price.</p>
<p>The post generated hundreds of comments, including some from people who seem to believe that all Latinos are unauthorized immigrants.</p>
<p>Faulconer can say San Diego isn&#8217;t a sanctuary city because, <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/border/neither-san-diego-nor-california-is-a-sanctuary-for-the-undocumented/" >as we explored</a>, the term has no meaning. San Diego has similar policies as proud sanctuary cities. The mayor even recently <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C6_uT4WVoAAWFKk.jpg"  target="_blank"   data-rel="lightbox-0" data-imagelightbox="0" title="">took the step</a> of assuring the City Council he would not let San Diego police be deputized by federal authorities to enforce immigration laws.</p>
<p>All that makes San Diego look like a supposed sanctuary city. However, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers are present in local jails and booking facilities. And an ICE official told me the agency has a strong relationship with local law enforcement.</p>
<p>Sessions cited only one law he is demanding cities comply with: 8 USC 1373, which merely prohibits local law enforcement from restricting the sharing of immigration status with federal officers. It&#8217;s hard to see how any city does not comply with that.</p>
<p><em>&#8211; Scott Lewis</em></p>
<h2>U-T Hammers SoccerCity Petitioners</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;ve bought groceries in San Diego lately, chances are good that you&#8217;ve come across a petition gatherer urging you to support a soccer stadium in our fair city. Stadium boosters need to collect more than 71,000 signatures within a few months in order to force the City Council to approve the SoccerCity development or put it before voters.</p>
<p>The pitch may seem pretty simple. But when the U-T talked to petition gatherers, it found that <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sports/chargers/sd-me-soccercity-20170327-story.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >many were spouting nonsense and lies</a>.</p>
<p>Among the misinformation, according to the U-T: &#8220;It’s a soccer project. But the massive development that accompanies it is either downplayed or denied.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Sea-Level Rise on the Mind</h2>
<p>KPBS summarizes the findings of a new report: &#8220;More than half of Southern California&#8217;s beaches <a href="http://www.kpbs.org/news/2017/mar/28/study-predicts-significant-southern-california-bea/"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >could completely erode back to coastal infrastructure or sea cliffs</a> by the year 2100 as the sea level rises.&#8221;</p>
<p>As we&#8217;ve reported, <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/science-environment/imperial-beach-braces-for-sea-level-rise/"  target="_blank">the mayor of Imperial Beach is worried</a> about &#8220;rising sea levels that could eventually impact 30 percent of the city’s properties, 40 percent of its roads, an elementary school and more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Imperial Beach and La Jolla Shores would be the most threatened of local beaches, the report believes.</p>
<h2>Heaven&#8217;s Gate Is Neither Gone Nor Forgotten</h2>
<p>This month marks the 20th anniversary of the Heaven&#8217;s Gate mass suicide. The mansion where it happened is gone, and a whole generation has grown up without remembering the shock of first hearing about a cult&#8217;s horrific end in Rancho Santa Fe. But the original Heaven&#8217;s Gate website remains online, a time capsule into the time of GeoCities and AOL.</p>
<p>A few years ago, the website Gizmodo explored <a href="http://gizmodo.com/the-online-legacy-of-a-suicide-cult-and-the-webmasters-1617403237"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >the cult&#8217;s unusual cyber-afterlife</a>. The story, which is worth another visit, begins this way: &#8220;Every month, the bills get paid on time. The emails get answered, and any orders filled. Which, for HeavensGate.com, is positively extraordinary. &#8221;</p>
<p>A couple Heaven&#8217;s Gate believers were still running the site as of 2014: &#8220;They refer to themselves simply as &#8216;Telah&#8217; and &#8216;we.'&#8221;</p>
<h2>Culture Report: South of the 8, on Stage</h2>
<p>This week&#8217;s <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/arts/culture-report-22/"  target="_blank">VOSD Culture Report</a> leads off with a look at &#8220;South of the 8,&#8221; a spoken-word performance by residents of the often-neglected southeastern San Diego neighborhoods. It&#8217;s part of an effort by the La Jolla Playhouse to reach beyond its usual audience.</p>
<p>Also in the Culture Report: A local filmmaker dies of cancer at the age of 29, a blogger puts Lyft drivers in the spotlight, and a new restaurant devotes all its profits to charity.</p>
<h2>Quick News Hits: Getting a Leg Up on Humanity</h2>
<p>• A committee of the San Diego Association of Governments is <a href="http://www.kpbs.org/news/2017/mar/28/seven-firms-competing-sandag-investigation-contrac/"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >looking at seven firms</a> that want to investigate the coalition of local government agencies over <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/government/omg-wtf-sandag-knew-its-forecasts-were-wrong-went-to-voters-with-false-promise-anyway-emails-show/"  target="_blank">the transit tax scandal that we uncovered</a>, KPBS reports. It&#8217;s not clear which firms are involved.</p>
<p>• The Washington Post has some <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/03/28/spiders-could-theoretically-eat-every-human-on-earth-in-one-year/?utm_term=.a9dc763e943d"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >disturbing news about spiders</a>: Annually, they &#8220;eat at least as much meat as all 7 billion humans on the planet combined.&#8221; And each year, they eat more than the equivalent of the weight of all 7 billion humans on the planet.</p>
<p>If the spiders rise up, we should be OK in San Diego, right? Sure, we have spiders around, and the county health folks <a href="http://www.sandiegocounty.gov/deh/pests/spiders.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >warn us</a> about the poisonous Black Widow, Brown Widow and Desert Recluse. But how many species can there be here, really?</p>
<p>Try 54 kinds of spider — <i>in just one place</i>. That&#8217;s the word from <a href="http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.3956/2009-23a.1"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >a 2010 report about spiders hanging out at the Cabrillo National Monument</a>. To make local matters more unfriendly for aracnophobes, the San Diego Zoo has its very own <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/03/28/spiders-could-theoretically-eat-every-human-on-earth-in-one-year/?utm_term=.a9dc763e943d"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >Arachnid Rescue Center</a> that&#8217;s full of tarantulas in distress, all the victims of wildlife trafficking.</p>
<p>Eek! I&#8217;m gonna head into my bedroom closet to protect myself from the Arachnoid Apocalypse. No spider will find me h&#8230; uh oh.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 2013, 26-year-old Robert Lubsen killed himself in a Vista jail. This month, the Citizens’ Law Enforcement Review Board, an independent body tasked with investigating deaths at county detention facility, got around to reviewing whether sheriff’s deputies were at fault for failing to place Lubsenon suicide watch.</p>
<p>Despite ligature marks on his neck from a previous suicide attempt, CLERB determined they weren’t at fault.</p>
<p>The suicide was the second oldest cast in CLERB’s backlog of inmate deaths requiring independent review. As <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/public-safety/two-men-at-obvious-risk-of-suicide-two-deaths-and-investigators-just-cleared-both-cases/" >Kelly Davis recounts in a new story</a>, that backlog has grown substantially in recent years, and there are now 46 open death investigations. That&#8217;s the most in CLERB’s 25-year history.</p>
<p>Lubsen’s family sued the county and settled in 2014, receiving assurances from Sheriff Bill Gore that it was changing protocol to make sure signs like Lubsen’s weren’t missed again. But then Jason Nishimoto hung himself in a Vista jail in 2015 despite being previously diagnosed as schizophrenic with a history of suicide attempts.</p>
<p>CLERB likewise found no evidence of fault for sheriff’s deputies in his case either.</p>
<h2>SDSU: Scratch That; We Need Land Soon, Not in 30 Years</h2>
<p>During a panel discussion last week, an SDSU vice president made a <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/land-use/sdsu-reveals-it-doesnt-need-qualcomm-stadium-land-yet/" >noteworthy statement</a>: the university needs the land at the site of Qualcomm Stadium for expansion, but not for 30 to 50 years. The university would build on the land at first with a for-profit developer. The push now for some of the land is more about securing the university’s long-term needs, he said.</p>
<p>Developers behind the SoccerCity proposal seized on it as a major admission.</p>
<p>As our Scott Lewis writes in <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/land-use/sdsu-wait-we-do-need-mission-valley-land-in-near-term/" >a new post</a>, Schulz followed up this weekend with a statement that the university actually does need the land in the more immediate future.</p>
<h2>San Diego Grapples With Trump’s Mexico Fight</h2>
<p>President Donald Trump’s promise to build a bigger and better border wall, pass a border tax and renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement has introduced a bit of turmoil to San Diego and Tijuana’s cozy relationship.</p>
<p>Leaders of the border cities, including San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer flew to Mexico City Monday to tout their efforts at cross-border collaboration, <a href="http://www.kpbs.org/news/2017/mar/27/san-diego-and-tijuana-leaders-push-regional-issues/"  target="_blank"  >as KPBS reported</a>.</p>
<p>“Obviously, there’s a conversation at the national level – it’s important for us as local leaders to talk about what’s working on the local level and the fact that we have such strong ties,” Faulconer told KPBS.</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> Meanwhile, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced Monday that federal grant money wouldn’t be available to jurisdictions that don’t follow a specific provision of federal immigration law.</p>
<p>It’s aimed at discouraging so-called sanctuary cities, an oft-used term that doesn’t actually have a very clear meaning at all, <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/border/neither-san-diego-nor-california-is-a-sanctuary-for-the-undocumented/" >as we covered last month</a>. A representative of Immigration and Customs Enforcement said that agency has a very good relationship with local law enforcement.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/immigration/sd-me-sessions-sanctuary-20170327-story.html"  target="_blank"  >The Union-Tribune dug into Sessions’ pronouncement</a>, finding that officials for both the city and county of San Diego say both jurisdictions would continue to be eligible for federal funds, despite the fact that they both appear on lists of sanctuary cities. Overall, jurisdictions within San Diego County received some $10.6 million from the Department of Justice last year.</p>
<p><strong>• </strong>And in Mexico, increased hostility from the Trump administration is making leaders wary about how much they’ve come to rely on natural gas from the United States, according to a <a href="http://www.kpbs.org/news/2017/mar/27/us-natural-gas-mexico-skyrockets-making-some-mexic/"  target="_blank"  >new story from inewsource</a>.</p>
<p>Natural gas exports to Mexico have increased 300 percent since 2010, and the country now gets 60 percent of all its natural gas from this country. Now, officials in Mexico are considered what alternatives they have to being so dependent on a country that has adopted an especially harsh tone of late.</p>
<h2>We Feel Your Pain, Oakland</h2>
<p>For the third time in 15 months, the NFL owners have approved the relocation of one of the league’s 32 franchises.</p>
<p>This time it’s the Oakland Raiders, who in 2020 will call Las Vegas their home.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2017/03/27/las-vegas-raiders-oakland-los-angeles-san-diego-st-louis-rams-chargers/99701878/"  target="_blank"  >USA Today used the relocation to take a look at what’s next</a> for St. Louis, San Diego and Oakland. In recent decades, cities that lost NFL teams inevitably got a new one, after they ponied up more public money to the league than they offered before the relocation.</p>
<p>Now, though, it’s unclear cities will take that route, with both St Louis and San Diego looking to soccer and the MLS to fill the gap.</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> The move <a href="https://twitter.com/markkersey/status/846446088290734081"  target="_blank"  >provoked</a> San Diego City Councilman Mark Kersey to ask congressional representatives to introduce a bill challenging the NFL&#8217;s anti-trust exemption. The NFL is allowed to act as a monopoly, which is very beneficial when it negotiates broadcast rights.</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> Oakland&#8217;s mayor <a href="https://t.co/b7B6zrI2Qw"  target="_blank"  >defiantly championed</a> her decision not to support public investment in a new football stadium.</p>
<h2>In Other News</h2>
<p><strong>• </strong>The New York Times reports that two little fault zones underneath San Diego <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/27/science/earthquake-fault-line-southern-california.html?smid=tw-nytimesscience&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;_r=0"  target="_blank"  >are actually one big one</a> that could produce an until-now unimagined, catastrophic earthquake. However: &#8220;Over all, the fault moves and accumulates stress at less than one-tenth the rate of the nearby San Andreas fault, meaning it is not likely to rupture,&#8221; said one of the researchers who made the finding.</p>
<p><strong>• </strong>Doug Applegate narrowly lost a challenge to longtime Vista-based Rep. Darrell Issa last year. He’s now facing questions over his campaign spending and just submitted a series of amendments that account for $370,000 in newly reported spending and other adjustments. (<a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/watchdog/sd-me-applegate-filing-20170327-story.html"  target="_blank"  >San Diego Union-Tribune</a>)</p>
<p><strong>• </strong>These bros have a righteous cause. If city leaders in San Clemente don’t accommodate them, those leaders should <a href="http://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/03/two-surfer-bros-plead-with-city-council-to-build-a-12-foot-paul-walker-statue"  target="_blank"  >provide</a> a full accounting to the public of what it is they have against a 12-foot Paul Walker statue. (<a href="http://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/03/two-surfer-bros-plead-with-city-council-to-build-a-12-foot-paul-walker-statue"  target="_blank"  >USA Today</a>)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When the founders of the Jacobs Center for Neighborhood Innovation started the organization in southeastern San Diego many years ago, the vision was to develop dozens of acres of land into community assets and to create a nonprofit to boost other community efforts. There was another piece of the mission that was more unique: Eventually, the leaders of the Jacobs Center would hand the whole thing off, and the community would take over.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not working out as planned: Development has lagged, <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/nonprofits/jacobs-center-southeastern-sd-landholder-sheds-key-staff-in-upheaval/" >the nonprofit is facing deep cuts and debt</a>. And, as Lisa Halverstadt reports in a new story, <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/nonprofits/jacobs-center-uncertain-how-to-end-itself-as-promised/" >there&#8217;s no real plan in place to hand off the efforts to the community as planned</a>.</p>
<p>At one point, the Jacobs family planned to bankroll efforts through 2020. That got pushed back until 2030. Now, the Jacobs Center says it&#8217;s still committed to eventually letting the community take the reins, but how and when it&#8217;ll get there is uncertain.</p>
<p>&#8220;(CEO Reginald) Jones, and Andrew Hapke, a Jacobs family member who serves on the nonprofit’s board, said they’re committed to handing all of the assets over to the community,&#8221; Halverstadt writes. &#8220;They plan to work with residents to lay out a definitive timeline and next steps in coming months. For now, they say the timeline for the Jacobs’ sunset rests heavily on when the Jacobs Center can push forward more development.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Students at Poor Schools Are Taking it From All Sides</h2>
<p>As Mario Koran has reported over the last couple weeks, <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/education/district-schools-facing-layoffs-overwhelmingly-poor/"  target="_blank">the poorest schools in the district are on track to absorb most of the blow</a> from the district&#8217;s multimillion-dollar budget cuts.</p>
<p>Disparate news stories that have trickled out over the last few days tell quite a story of what it&#8217;s like to go to school in a disadvantaged area.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/public-safety/sd-me-man-dead-gompers-20170324-story.html"  target="_blank"  >A man&#8217;s body was found outside of Gompers Preparatory Academy</a> on Friday, the second death in that area in just hours. Last year, parents told Koran that they send their kids to charters like Gompers in southeastern San Diego <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/education/in-search-of-safe-harbor-parents-look-beyond-neighborhood-schools/"  target="_blank">precisely because they think they&#8217;ll be more safe there</a> than at traditional district schools. Schools in southeastern San Diego have been <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/public-safety/sd-me-lockdown-gun-20170215-story.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >put on lockdown</a> numerous times in the last few months <a href="http://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/After-Reports-of-Shots-Fired-OFarrell-Charter-School-Put-on-Lockdown-412624753.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >over violent incidents nearby</a>.</p>
<p>On top of violence and teacher layoffs, students in southeastern San Diego also face environmental issues. Officials discovered lead in the water at the shared campus of Emerson-Bandini and the San Diego Co-operative Charter School. Lead testing across San Diego Unified schools will begin &#8220;at the southeast corner of the district where some of the oldest district schools are located,&#8221; <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/education/sd-me-unified-water-20170323-story.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >reports the Union-Tribune</a>.</p>
<h2>The Heat Turns Up on Hunter, Issa</h2>
<p>Rep. Duncan Hunter is in trouble over his misuse of campaign funds for personal expenses, something he has attributed to mistakes and mix-ups.</p>
<p>Though he&#8217;s been facing heat from the Union-Tribune&#8217;s relentless reporting on the issue, Hunter is now also the subject of two different investigations over his spending. One is from the House Committee on Ethics, the other is from the Justice Department. The Justice Department last week told the House committee to stand down until its probe is complete. <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/watchdog/sd-me-hunter-folo-20170324-story.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >That move, reports, the Union-Tribune, indicates things are serious</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Political law experts say it’s rare for the Justice Department to ask the Ethics Committee to hold off on its own investigation. In recent instances, some lawmakers have ended up behind bars,&#8221; according to the paper.</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> Since Rep. Darrell Issa narrowly eked out a victory in November, he&#8217;s been striking <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/politics/sd-me-politicalnb-0319-story.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >a much more moderate tone</a>. Still, <a href="http://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/Ads-to-Thank-Darrell-Issa-for-Replacing-Obamacare-Air-After-Bill-Pulled--417101213.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >an ad that ran this weekend might have showed the congressman&#8217;s hand</a>: It thanked Issa for his vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act, even though House Republicans pulled their repeal bill on Friday without a vote.</p>
<p>Attorney Mike Levin, a Democrat who is challenging Issa in 2018, appeared on MSNBC on Saturday, where he <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/am-joy"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >said that Issa&#8217;s softened tone hasn&#8217;t come with a change in actual votes</a> or outlook on policies: &#8220;When you look at how he actually votes, he has been in lockstep with Trump every step of the way. &#8230; There isn&#8217;t a single piece of legislation where he has not supported the Trump position.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>San Diego State University wants a big chunk of land in Mission Valley around Qualcomm Stadium, but the university doesn&#8217;t need the land for educational purposes until the year 2047 or later.</p>
<p>The university wants 35 acres of land there and is ready to build a $150 million stadium. <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/land-use/sdsu-reveals-it-doesnt-need-qualcomm-stadium-land-yet/" >But it wouldn&#8217;t use the rest of the land for classrooms or faculty housing</a>, at least not yet. Instead, it would own the property and lease it out as &#8220;office-type space,&#8221; said Bob Schulz, the lead architect and an associate vice president at SDSU.</p>
<p>Scott Lewis reports on this revelation, which Shulz made to a crowd of land-use experts this week.</p>
<p>The disclosure undermines the notion that the university needs the land to expand its educational offerings and serve students in the next several years.</p>
<p>At <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/education/sd-me-sdsu-qualcomm-20161110-story.html"  target="_blank"  >a press conference in November</a>, then-state Sen. Marty Block pointed to a picture of a campus in Mission Valley and said, “Imagine if you will in a handful of years having this concrete jungle turned into a river park, a beautiful kind of bucolic green campus with academic buildings, with faculty housing, student housing, perhaps a biotech park in one corner and an on-campus football stadium.&#8221;</p>
<p>If that ever happens, it wouldn&#8217;t be in a &#8220;handful of years&#8221; after all.</p>
<h2>Sacramento Report: Changing County Elections</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/government/sacramento-report-state-reps-want-to-change-county-elections-county-reps-not-so-much/" >In this week&#8217;s round-up of news from Sacramento</a>, we report on how two Democratic Assembly members want to change how the all-Republican San Diego County Board of Supervisors is elected. Also in the Sacramento Report: Maya Srikrishnan tells us about a bill that Encinitas is backing to get more than 1,000 accessory dwelling units or granny flats – smaller homes that share a property with a main house – to count toward its state-mandated affordable housing goals.</p>
<p>And Sara Libby writes that Assemblywoman Shirley Weber is taking another crack at reforming teacher tenure in California.</p>
<h2>VOSD Podcast: SDSU and Hotel Tax Hike</h2>
<p>Andy Keatts and Lewis <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/news/vosd-podcast-17/" >talk about SDSU&#8217;s play in Mission Valley on this week&#8217;s podcast</a>, as well as Mayor Kevin Faulconer&#8217;s push to hold a special election this fall to raise hotel taxes. The higher taxes would pay for an expansion of the convention center, more services for the homeless and road repairs.</p>
<p>Republican Ron Nehring also joined the podcast, and said he thinks Faulconer is an ideal candidate for governor.</p>
<h2>Opinion: The Devil in the SoccerCity Details</h2>
<p>Theresa Quiroz, a planning commissioner, <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/opinion/troubling-issues-hidden-fine-print-soccercity-plan/" >took a hard look at the SoccerCity plan </a>for Mission Valley. She finds that, contrary to &#8220;bright and shiny baubles&#8221; being used to market the development, there are things in the deal that don&#8217;t sound so hot. For instance, she writes, the plan allows public subsidies to go to a professional sports team, despite suggestions to the contrary.</p>

<h2>The Week&#8217;s Top Stories</h2>
<p><em>These were the most popular Voice of San Diego stories for the week of Mar. 18-Mar. 24. <a href="www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/news/top-stories-mar-18-mar-24/" target="_blank">Click here to see the full top 10</a>.</em></p>
<p><strong>1. <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/government/change-rein-costs-wildly-expensive-mid-coast-trolley-project" >This Change Could Rein in Costs on the Wildly Expensive Mid-Coast Trolley Project</a></strong><br />
The cost of SANDAG’s highest-profile projects, the Mid-Coast Corridor Transit Project to extend the Blue Line north to the UCSD campus, is especially high for a light-rail project. But there is a change SANDAG could consider that would reduce the price tag and take advantage of both existing light-rail lines and the Coaster rail line. (Alon Levy)</p>
<p><strong>2. <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/education/why-district-layoffs-hit-poor-schools-the-hardest" >Why District Layoffs Hit Poor Schools the Hardest</a></strong><br />
That layoffs hit the poorest schools hardest is generally accepted as true – both by people who want to preserve the current system of teacher protections and those who want to dismantle it. (Mario Koran)</p>
<p><strong>3. <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/education/district-schools-facing-layoffs-overwhelmingly-poor" >The District Schools Facing the Most Layoffs Are Overwhelmingly Poor</a></strong><br />
Low-income schools are set to bear the brunt of San Diego Unified’s multimillion-dollar budget cuts. For 16 of the 20 schools in San Diego Unified facing the most teacher layoff notices, at least 75 percent of students qualify for free and reduced-price lunch. (Mario Koran)</p>
<p><strong>4. <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/education/san-diegos-bilingual-paradox" >San Diego’s Bilingual Paradox</a></strong><br />
San Diego sits at a binational crossroads, perfectly positioned to provide bilingual job candidates in a variety of fields. But local employers still struggle to find qualified bilingual candidates. Employers, language experts and teachers point to one root cause for the disconnect: a public education system that has restricted bilingual education for the past 18 years. (Adriana Heldiz and Mario Koran)</p>
<p><strong>5. <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/science-environment/southern-california-is-drowning-in-drought-proofing-projects" >Southern California Is Drowning in Drought-Proofing Projects</a></strong><br />
Water agencies are working on dozens of projects to boost Southern California’s water supply. But many of the agencies are simultaneously boosting their own projects and arguing that others shouldn’t be built – partly out of a fear that ratepayers will only tolerate so many projects, and partly because of politics and territorialism.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Perhaps the drought has made our region a little oversensitive to issues of water insecurity, or perhaps we are just a bunch of eager problem-solvers. Either way, the reality is that our region is now awash with <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/science-environment/southern-california-is-drowning-in-drought-proofing-projects/"  target="_blank">huge plans to generate, move and store sources of water</a> to shore up the water security of Southern California. Ry Rivard reports on how this leads to a strange problem: water agencies opposing plans to help the state get through future droughts.</p>
<p>Water agencies can see the large number of water plans across California and are predicting ratepayers will eventually demand a stop to costly new projects. &#8220;Water agencies with their own projects want to be sure they’re not the last one standing before ratepayer support dries up,&#8221; Rivard reports.</p>
<p>All these water projects tend to result in their intended effect: getting more water into our region. But one recent report says we may be headed toward facing a problem of having too much water if many desired projects get done.</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> In a related note, all of the sudden a lot of people are <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/pomerado-news/opinion/editorial/so-cal-focus/sd-elias-desal-loses-urgency-20170323-story.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >a lot less excited about desalination</a> plants. (Union-Tribune)</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/03/22/us/california-measuring-snowpack.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >has some &#8220;good news&#8221;</a> (and some pretty photos) about the California drought.</p>
<h2>The Learning Curve: Keeping Teachers at Needy Schools</h2>
<p>We&#8217;ve been writing a lot recently about teacher layoffs coming to San Diego Unified, and how the layoffs disproportionately hit poorer schools the hardest. That&#8217;s because there&#8217;s a lot of new teachers at poorer schools who are exposed to layoffs due to their shorter employment. Mario Koran notes that, while there are many reasons why experienced teachers move to more affluent schools, <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/must-reads/know-teachers-leave-poor-schools-not-make-stay/"  target="_blank">nobody has figured out how to fix the problem</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not as easy as just offering more money. &#8220;Evidence suggests financial incentives haven’t led to great results elsewhere,&#8221; Koran reports. Some local schools have been able to hang on to experienced teachers by offering a more collaborative environment, by offering perks like childcare or simply by nature of having a likable principal. But good principals often can&#8217;t stay put either, Koran writes. &#8220;They’re often promoted to larger schools or management positions.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Bond Measure Footnotes: San Diego Explained</h2>
<p>Bond measures to help schools build and maintain facilities often pass with a promise that bond money <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/education/san-diego-explained-school-bond-funds-can-spent-employees/"  target="_blank">won&#8217;t be used to pay the salaries of teachers and administrators</a>. But for the last decade, school districts up and down California have been using bond money to pay salaries for staff who have jobs related to projects funded by the bond. Ashly McGlone and NBC 7&#8217;s Monica Dean find that bit of fine print and show how much bond money is going to salaries in our most recent San Diego Explained.</p>
<h2>Rep. Hunter Under Federal Investigation</h2>
<p>Buried under a mountain of reporting about campaign fund misuse, Rep. Duncan Hunter is now <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/duncan-hunter-campaign-finance-investigation-236422"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >under investigation by the Justice Department</a>, Politico reports. The House Ethics Committee is holding off on an investigation of its own in deference to the Justice Department&#8217;s. The Union-Tribune&#8217;s Morgan Cook, who&#8217;s broken several of the Hunter finance stories, notes the variety of personal expenses <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/watchdog/sd-me-hunter-ethics-20170323-story.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >Hunter paid for using campaign money</a>, including airfare for his pet rabbit, video games for his kids and oral surgery.</p>
<h2>San Diego Unified Sends an Immigration Message</h2>
<p>Santa Clara County is suing to stop President Trump&#8217;s executive order that would withhold federal money from so-called sanctuary cities and jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The San Diego Unified Board <a href="https://www.aclusandiego.org/california-school-districts-support-santa-clara-countys-challenge-trump-executive-orders-immigration/"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >signed on to an amicus brief</a> on Thursday in support of Santa Clara&#8217;s law suit. School Board President Richard Barrera argues students should be afraid of deportations when they go to school, and neither &#8220;should school administrators be forced to choose between critical funding and violating students’ rights,” he says in an ACLU press release about the brief.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/education/schools-try-thread-needle-soothing-deportation-fears-overpromising/"  target="_blank">Schools are in a tough spot</a> in regards to protecting students from deportation efforts, Mario Koran has reported. Though it makes sense to assure parents and families that they&#8217;re welcome at school, &#8220;Any municipality or school that guarantees people that ICE can’t get to them in that location is giving people false hope,” an immigration attorney told Koran.</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> KPBS looks into what President Trump&#8217;s budget proposals <a href="http://www.kpbs.org/news/2017/mar/23/whats-menu-school-lunch-reform-under-trump/"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >would mean for kids who eat school lunch</a>.</p>

(Union-Tribune)</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> San Diego County&#8217;s grand jury finds San Diegans are paying hundreds of thousands of dollars per year to <a href="http://www.10news.com/news/grand-jury-san-diegos-trash-cans-are-brittle-and-the-city-should-replace-them-for-free"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >replace trash bins busted up by collection vehicles</a> and recommends the city provide free replacements instead. (10News)</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> Carlsbad&#8217;s Encina power plant will stay open despite previous plans, which means its cooling process &#8220;that traps fish, seals, sea lions, turtles and other creatures&#8221; and kills them will <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/business/sd-fi-carlsbad-energycenter-20170321-story.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >remain in operation possibly through 2018</a>.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s a case of same-as-it-ever-was: As in the past, the layoffs planned by the San Diego Unified district will <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/education/district-schools-facing-layoffs-overwhelmingly-poor/"  target="_blank">hit poor schools th</a>e<a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/education/district-schools-facing-layoffs-overwhelmingly-poor/"  target="_blank"> most</a> because they&#8217;re the ones avoided by teachers who have the seniority to get out of losing their jobs.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/education/district-schools-facing-layoffs-overwhelmingly-poor/"  target="_blank">the 20 schools facing the most teacher layoff notices are overwhelmingly poor</a>; at 16, at least 75 percent of students qualifying for free and reduced-price lunches. &#8220;Because teachers are placed in schools based on seniority, the more senior teachers generally seek more affluent schools with better test scores, and the system has a detrimental impact on the poorest schools,&#8221; our Mario Koran reports.</p>
<p>While the district and teachers union wouldn&#8217;t provide lists of schools with highest layoff rates, we obtained them. The percentage of teachers facing layoffs at the 20 schools ranges from 39 percent to 80 percent. Most are elementary schools, many with small numbers of teachers.</p>
<h2>Opinion: Density Isn&#8217;t a Dirty Word, But &#8230;</h2>
<p>San Diegans haven&#8217;t been big fans of density lately, as they&#8217;ve objected to several proposed developments.</p>
<p>So are we a bunch of anti-density Neanderthals who&#8217;ll continue scarfing up land and fossil fuels because we prefer it that way? Nope, writes John Horst, former chairman of the Mira Mesa Community Planning Group, in <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/opinion/san-diego-will-continue-to-say-no-to-density-without-urban-upgrades-first/"  target="_blank">a VOSD commentary</a>. Instead, he argues, &#8220;what folks don’t like is the traffic and other problems that come when new density and development aren’t preceded by necessary infrastructure upgrades.&#8221;</p>
<p>He adds: &#8220;Once permits are issued and development commences, there is currently no process in the city or county — nor political will — to enforce promises of infrastructure. The older neighborhoods where density is being proposed first need significant upgrades to streets, sewer, water systems and public facilities like fire stations.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> City Attorney Mara Elliott has signaled that she&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/LisaHalverstadt/status/844682893913812992"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >open to tiny homes</a> as a possible legal solution to homelessness: &#8220;We&#8217;ll be watching San Jose, the first city to try this approach, to learn from their experiences,&#8221; Eliott tweeted Tuesday. For background, check the <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/homelessness/sd-me-tiny-expo-20170321-story.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >U-T&#8217;s coverage</a>.</p>
<h2>Convention Center Vote This Year?</h2>
<p>Mayor Kevin Faulconer is <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/business/tourism/sd-fi-convention-vote-20170322-story.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >pushing for a vote on a convention center expansion this year</a>, the U-T reports. At issue: Should taxes on hotel guests be hiked to help pay for it? Two-thirds of voters would have to agree, a pretty big obstacle in tax-averse San Diego, even among the tiny number of voters who&#8217;d be expected to turn out. A mayor&#8217;s office official says the rush is to get it approved before construction costs go up even more.</p>
<p>The measure <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/government/guide-mayors-new-homelessness-plans/"  target="_blank">could include money for street repairs and help for the homeless too</a>.</p>
<h2>Politics Roundup: Brown Lays it Down</h2>
<p>Gov. Jerry Brown is in Washington D.C, where he&#8217;s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/22/us/california-today-in-washington-jerry-brown-talks-terror.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=second-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >warning of armageddon</a> and supporting legislation that would require the president to go to Congress and get approval before using nuclear weapons, reports the New York Times.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s also <a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-gov-jerry-brown-warns-of-at-least-a-6-1490199313-htmlstory.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >bashing the American Health Care Act, or Trumpcare</a>, saying a big expense will come calling in 2020 under the GOP plan: &#8220;It&#8217;s real when you, all of a sudden, send a $6 billion tax bill to the state of California,&#8221; reports the L.A. Times.</p>
<h2>Trumpcare Vote: Where Issa Stands</h2>
<p><strong>•</strong> With the big House vote scheduled today on Trumpcare, one local Republican, Rep. Darrell Issa is now listed as &#8220;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/03/20/us/politics/health-care-whip-count.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >support or lean yes</a>&#8221; by the New York Times, although he&#8217;s expressed skepticism recently, and the L.A. Times was still listing him as a <a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-gop-healthcare-house-vote-2017-htmlstory.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >possible no vote</a>.</p>
<p>The other local Republican, Rep. Duncan Hunter, is a definite yes.</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> Wallethub is out with <a href="https://wallethub.com/edu/cities-most-affected-by-trumpcare/33588/"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >a ranking of larger American cities</a> based on how much Trumpcare would affect people who buy their own health insurance instead of getting it through work or Medicare/Medicaid.</p>
<p>Residents in Yuma, Ariz., not far from us, would be the most devastated: The average tax subsidy there for those with individual insurance coverage is now $12,815 and would decline by $7,815 under Trumpcare. In Escondido, average subsidies would actually grow by $2,983; they&#8217;d grow by $3,458 in Oceanside and $5,000 in Chula Vista and San Diego.</p>
<h2>A Shocking Death at the Border</h2>
<p>Three years ago, a 16-year-old crossed the border into the U.S. at San Ysidro and was pulled aside. The Washington Post explains what reportedly happened next: &#8220;He was carrying two bottles of liquid that he claimed was apple juice. U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers told him to drink it to prove he wasn’t lying, court records say. The teen took four sips. Then, he began sweating profusely. He screamed and clenched his fists.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy, who was actually carrying liquid meth, died. Now, the U.S. will pay his family &#8220;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/03/21/u-s-border-agents-made-a-mexican-teen-drink-liquid-meth-his-family-won-1-million-for-his-death/?hpid=hp_hp-more-top-stories_pn-borderagents-3pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&amp;utm_term=.165ebe85df57"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >$1 million in a wrongful-death lawsuit</a> brought against two border officers and the U.S. government.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> An MTV podcast called The Stakes <a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/podcasts/the-stakes/"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >visits the border&#8217;s Friendship Park</a>, &#8220;the only place where people on either side may meet face-to-face.&#8221;</p>
<p>The AV Club, a pop culture news site, <a href="http://www.avclub.com/live/explore-l-ron-hubbards-early-days-black-magic-and--252275"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >summarizes the episode</a>: It&#8217;s a &#8220;heartrending story focuses on many of the people who seek to make the park a sanctuary, from a yoga teacher leading binational classes to a pastor preaching salient messages of freedom. It’s the story’s central figures who offer the clearest picture of the awful and random nature of immigrant affairs today. They are a pair of recently separated siblings: one a legal U.S. citizen by birth, the other brought into the country at age 2 and recently deported during a routine status check.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Remembering the Black Panthers in S.D.</h2>
<p>KPBS explores <a href="http://www.kpbs.org/news/2017/mar/22/history-san-diego-black-panther-party-marked-socia/"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >the history of the Black Panthers in San Diego</a>; the organization is now reactivating. In the 1960s, the group &#8220;provided meals for the elderly, opened health clinics and served food to the homeless. They also started a breakfast program for schoolchildren.&#8221;</p>
<p>But their rise was also marked by controversy and violence. &#8220;According to a U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence report, FBI officials helped stoke rivalry between the Panther Party in San Diego and the United Slaves Organization. Two people were killed and four others were wounded as a result,&#8221; KPBS reports. &#8220;There was also an investigation into civil rights abuses by San Diego police officers against the Black Panthers.&#8221;</p>
<h2>For Once, a Development Fight Has a Happy Ending</h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s some news you don&#8217;t see every day: <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/news/north-county-report-behold-a-development-battle-with-a-happy-ending/"  target="_blank">a happy ending over a high-profile development</a>. An attorney tells VOSD&#8217;s weekly North County Report that a settlement agreement over a Carlsbad development in the Aviara neighborhood is an example of how &#8220;when parties are willing to work together, a project can benefit the residents, developers and the city.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also in the North County Report: More about Carlsbad&#8217;s Big Brother approach to monitoring drivers in the city and another housing lawsuit in Encinitas. And: County Supervisor Kristin Gaspar is taking the raise she didn&#8217;t support.</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> Real city, fake news! A new satirical story <a href="http://www.theonion.com/article/man-keeping-running-total-how-many-people-gym-wors-55573"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >begins this way</a> in The Onion: &#8220;ENCINITAS, CA — Intently scanning the room for signs of fatigue or excessive perspiration, local gym member Brian O’Grady reportedly kept a tally Monday of how many people were in worse shape than him.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like I have a twin!</p>
<h2>Quick News Hits: All Un-Together Now &#8230;</h2>
<p><strong>•</strong> University of California schools have already hiked their tuition by 2.5 percent, and now the powers that be at the California State University have <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-essential-education-updates-southern-cal-state-trustees-approve-1490211404-htmlstory.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >raised tuition</a> by about 5 percent, the L.A. Times reports. However, the tuition hike won&#8217;t affect about 60 percent of CSU students, the paper says, since they have scholarships or waivers.</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> Those retro <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/21/us/california-today-a-1960s-license-plate-revival.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=second-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=1"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >black-and-yellow California license plates are a hit</a>, with more than 230,000 issued in just a few months.</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> A bar in Kearny Mesa <a href="http://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/Chorus-Karaoke-Expands-Into-Hive-Restaurant-Bar-Club-Convoy-Street-416383683.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >plans to expand to 14 private karaoke rooms</a> where small groups of people can gather to sing poorly without getting mocked by bar patrons at large.</p>
<p>Oh man. How am I supposed to feel superior now? If this trend keeps up, I may have to resort to Plan B — silently heckling random people who hum on the street.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>San Diego sits at the southwestern corner of one nation and the northwestern corner of another, a binational hot spot where speaking Spanish can be very helpful for a variety of workers. But while employers often seek bilingual applicants locally, they frequently can&#8217;t find them.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the problem? &#8220;Employers, language experts and teachers point to one root cause: <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/education/san-diegos-bilingual-paradox/"  target="_blank">a public education system that restricted bilingual education</a> for the past 18 years,&#8221; write VOSD&#8217;s Adriana Heldiz and Mario Koran in a new story.</p>
<p>Last fall, state voters approved a ballot measure that will make it easier for schools to embrace bilingual education. But it will take a while for things to change. Right now, only two school districts in the county offer students a strong bilingual pathway from grade school to high school.</p>
<p>But don&#8217;t many English-learners already speak Spanish? Yes, but critics of the current system say some suffer from “language shame&#8221; about their native Spanish and fail to learn to speak, read and write it at an advanced level.</p>
<h2>Inside the Mayor&#8217;s Homeless Strategy</h2>
<p>Some of San Diego&#8217;s most outspoken advocates for the homeless say permanent housing is the ideal solution and deserves almost all the focus. But what should happen now? In a new story, VOSD&#8217;s Lisa Halverstadt <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/government/for-the-homeless-mayor-wants-a-big-tent-now-homes-later/"  target="_blank">explores the thinking of Mayor Kevin Faulconer</a> and others.</p>
<p>Faulconer seems to want to have it both ways, Halverstadt writes: He wants to embrace the permanent housing solution, but also create short-term beds.</p>
<p>As the city&#8217;s homeless czar explained this week, &#8220;her goal to add hundreds of new, temporary shelter beds — at least 300. She described efforts to assess many potential locations. She’d like to see those beds open within 90 days of finding a site, and have them stay open for about two years.&#8221;</p>
<p>The shelter beds might even be under a tent, an approach that Faulconer was happy to abandon a while back.</p>
<p>But a homeless advocate recently expressed his fears about the city&#8217;s priorities: &#8220;I am deathly afraid that if we try to do both (permanent housing and shelter), we are going to do the emergency shelter and not the things we need to do to solve homelessness in this community.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Push to Fix City&#8217;s Insane Sidewalk Policies</h2>
<p>As we put it in a helpful headline a few years ago, &#8220;<a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/government/two-years-on-illogical-sidewalk-policies-still-illogical/"  target="_blank">Illogical Sidewalk Policies Still Illogical</a>.&#8221; In general, the city of San Diego requires property owners to keep sidewalks repaired, but taxpayers are on the hook if there&#8217;s a lawsuit over an accident.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to revamp the policy in such a fashion that it works,&#8221; Councilman Mark Kersey said in 2013. Now, in 2017, another councilman, David Alvarez, is singing an identical tune.</p>
<p>Why now? As the U-T reports, Alvarez&#8217;s call for change <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/politics/sd-me-government-0322-story.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >comes in the wake of the city&#8217;s $5 million settlement</a> in the case of a bike rider who suffered serious injuries when he &#8220;was launched 28 feet on his bike by tree-damaged sidewalk in Del Cerro.&#8221;</p>
<h2>SDSU Has Its Own Ideas for Qualcomm Property</h2>
<p>San Diego State <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/business/growth-development/sd-fi-soccercity-sdsu-20170321-story.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >wants to buy or lease a big chunk of the football stadium property</a> in Mission Valley, the U-T reports, with an eye on building its own stadium.</p>
<p>So is SDSU trying to prevent the SoccerCity project from reaching the goal line? Not exactly, says the university&#8217;s athletic director, but the words of the university&#8217;s &#8220;needs&#8221; statement tell the real story: There&#8217;s no mention of Major League Soccer.</p>
<h2>Politics Roundup: Council Rejects Board Vote Revamp</h2>
<p>The City Council <a href="https://www.sandiego.gov/citycouncil/cd6/news"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >rejected</a> <a href="http://www.kpbs.org/news/2017/mar/21/plan-impose-term-limits-san-diego-unified-board-me/"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >a Republican-supported plan</a> to change how San Diego Unified school board members are elected, and to impose term limits (there aren&#8217;t any now). Such a move could have upended the board&#8217;s labor-backed board.</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> The County Board of Supervisors <a href="https://timesofsandiego.com/politics/2017/03/21/supervisors-vote-stand-sacramentos-assault-local-control/"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >won&#8217;t support a state bill</a> that would <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/government/gonzalez-bill-reform-sandag-make-san-diegos-mayor-way-powerful/"  target="_blank">dramatically change</a> the way SANDAG is run.</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> The county <a href="http://www.kpbs.org/news/2017/mar/21/board-supervisors-consider-excess-county-property-/"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >may get rid of some of its property that it doesn&#8217;t need</a> to provide space for affordable housing. (City News Service)</p>
<p>County Supervisor Ron Roberts is now chair of the Regional Task Force on the Homeless and told us last week he’s committed to looking at what the county can do to help with the housing crisis.</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> The Sacramento Bee reports on how endangered Republican congressmen in California like Rep. Darrell Issa are <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/article139871888.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >distancing themselves from the president</a>. The Bee tries to have some fun by describing Issa&#8217;s North County/Orange County district as &#8220;a stretch of sunshine, sand and smoothies,&#8221; which would come as news to his constituents in places like Vista and Rancho Peñasquitos.</p>
<p>Issa is &#8220;a lonely Republican voice calling for an independent investigation of ties between Trump associates and Russia,&#8221; the Bee says.</p>
<h2>Culture Report: So Sew We All</h2>
<p>This week&#8217;s <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/arts/culture-report-reap-sew/"  target="_blank">VOSD Culture Report</a> leads off with news about a new sewing-centered public art project that began a few months ago with &#8220;a series of workshops at 32 schools, homeless shelters, senior centers, after-school programs and other community centers. Over 1,000 people showed up to the various workshops and used giant looms to weave together ripped-up old T-shirts into sculptural works of art.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also in the Culture Report: A new Comic-Con museum in Balboa Park, a variety of fates for artifacts at the soon-to-be-defunct Hall of Champions and the departure of the executive director of Balboa Park’s San Diego Art Institute.</p>
<p>• The Old Globe Theater got a shout-out of sorts in this week&#8217;s episode of the FX show &#8220;Feud: Bette and Joan.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a scene that takes place during the filming of the classic horror film &#8220;What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?&#8221; Bette Davis wonders aloud about the bona fides of young actor Victor Buono. The film&#8217;s director assures her that he&#8217;s legit and has performed at the Old Globe in San Diego. “I’m sure his Falstaff is the talk of Tijuana,&#8221; she snaps.</p>
<p>Davis learns to like Buono, a San Diego native who earned a supporting actor nomination for his role in the movie.</p>
<h2>Quick News Hits: Smile, You&#8217;re on Carlsbad Camera!</h2>
<p><strong>•</strong> &#8220;Two mothers are <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/education/sd-me-longfellow-complaints-20170320-story.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >seeking a restraining order</a> to keep to a teacher away from their children and dozens of other parents also have complained about him to San Diego Unified School District trustees,&#8221; the U-T reports. They allege that the teacher, who works at Longfellow Elementary in Clairemont, is a bully.</p>
<p>The principal said in a statement that the concerns are &#8220;serious,&#8221; and &#8220;we have established a co-teaching model where a second teacher is in the classroom to make sure students can continue to learn in a safe, nurturing and welcoming environment.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> Here&#8217;s a sentence I didn&#8217;t expect to ever read: &#8220;Some residents say the 7-Eleven &#8230; will make the neighborhood more expensive.&#8221; It appears in <a href="http://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2017/mar/20/stringers-cherokee-point-no-north-park/"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >a Reader story about concerns about gentrification</a> in San Diego&#8217;s Cherokee Point neighborhood, &#8220;in the middle of North Park and City Heights, off of 36th Street.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> Two decades have passed since the Heaven&#8217;s Gate mass suicide in Rancho Santa Fe. What&#8217;s happened since? &#8220;The mansion was razed, the name of the street where it sat changed to discourage looky-loos, and Heaven’s Gate settled into its place as a bizarre footnote in San Diego County history. For sociologists and religious studies scholars, though, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-heavens-gate-20170319-story.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >Heaven’s Gate remains in orbit</a>.&#8221; (That last sentence doesn&#8217;t make a lot of sense, but I appreciate the wordplay effort.) (U-T)</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> The North County city of Carlsbad is planning to <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-carlsbad-license-plates-20170320-story.html#nt=oft07a-3gp1"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >install license plate-reading cameras at 14 intersections</a>, the U-T reports, so it can capture images of every car that enters the city.</p>
<p>Privacy advocates are not pleased, and a resident warned of &#8220;mass surveillance.&#8221; But city officials say they won&#8217;t misuse the information.</p>
<p>This brings up important questions: Can we trust Carlsbad? Are some local cities more or less trustworthy than others? It&#8217;s hard to know for sure, but let&#8217;s just say that I&#8217;m not lending La Mesa any money. It knows what it did.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Arts District Liberty Station was created to insulate artists from the rising rents that often pushed them out of San Diego neighborhoods.</p>
<p>But a decade later, the artists and cultural nonprofits that put down roots there are facing the same story as anywhere else: The rent is too damn high.</p>
<p>VOSD’s Kinsee Morlan <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/arts/even-space-cash-strapped-arts-groups-rent-damn-high/" >walks us through</a> how the arts district has found itself in the very situation it had tried to solve and how it has challenged the arts district’s identity.</p>
<p>From the beginning, city leaders agreed that an arts district was a worthy cause, but never committed to subsidizing rent for artists or giving the project a steady stream of funding.</p>
<p>The foundation created to open and operate the space built a lot of debt at the outset, when it was renovating buildings. Eventually, that debt and other increased costs, like wages and unexpected property taxes, were passed on to tenants.</p>
<p>The foundation board started courting tenants with more money, who could fund their own renovations in exchange for reduced rent to solve the problem. But the strategy has had consequences — not everyone thinks Liberty Station has achieved the vision it set out to achieve with the district.</p>
<h2>Residents Demand Action at Marathon Homelessness Hearing</h2>
<p>The City Council heard a slew of proposals and ideas to chip away at San Diego’s growing homelessness problem in <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/politics/sd-me-homeless-hearing-20170320-story.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >an hours-long hearing on Monday</a>.</p>
<p>Council members got a review of the challenges facing the region — including the relative <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/nonprofits/san-diego-has-few-resources-to-ensure-the-newly-homeless-dont-become-the-chronically-homeless/"  target="_blank">lack of programs to prevent homelessness</a> and San Diego’s dearth of affordable housing — and listened to a number of homeless folks and residents frustrated with the city’s response so far. They also heard from county and city bureaucrats who reviewed their own short- and long-term plans to better aid San Diego’s homeless population.</p>
<p>City Council members left the meeting vowing action. Council President Myrtle Cole called for the creation of select committee on homelessness, while City Councilman Chris Ward, who represents central city neighborhoods, talked up <a href="http://twitdoc.com/view.asp?id=360562&amp;sid=7Q7M&amp;ext=PDF&amp;lcl=Memo-Homeless-Strategies-03-20-17-Final.pdf&amp;usr=ChrisWardD3"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >a series of policy proposals</a>. Councilwomen Barbara Bry and Georgette Gomez requested a study of what the city could do for its homeless population with a quarter-cent sales tax or a bond. And Councilwoman Lorie Zapf asked City Attorney Mara Elliott to look into what San Diego could do to demand more support to address <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/nonprofits/homelessness-is-exploding-downtown-what-we-know-and-dont-about-why/"  target="_blank">side effects of Prop. 47</a>, a 2014 ballot measure she’s argued has contributed to an increase in street homelessness.</p>

<h2>Border Talk</h2>
<p>Three state legislators, including San Diego Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez, introduced a bill Monday that would require the California Public Employee Retirement System and the California State Teachers Retirement System to divest from any company involved in President Donald Trump’s proposed border wall.</p>
<p>CalPERS and CalSTRS are the nation’s largest and second largest pension funds, with nearly $312 billion and $202 billion in investments under their control, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-california-shouldn-t-invest-in-1490034477-htmlstory.html"  target="_blank"  >reports the L.A. Times</a>. The AB 946 announcement follows last week’s U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s request for companies to submit formal border wall prototypes.</p>
<p>“This is a wall of shame and we don’t want any part of it,” wrote one of the legislators, San Francisco Assemblyman Phil Ting, in a press release.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People on the brink of homelessness, or those new to the streets, are easier and cheaper to help than those who&#8217;ve been homeless for years.</p>
<p>Cities that&#8217;ve greatly reduced their homeless populations know this, and have boosted programs targeted at prevention and quick intervention.</p>
<p>While San Diego has a growing number of newly homeless, it has yet to really focus on helping those folks. Instead, local programs often prioritize housing homeless veterans and those who’ve spent years on the streets.</p>
<p>VOSD&#8217;s Lisa Halverstadt is out with a new story on our region&#8217;s <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/all-narratives/homelessness/san-diego-has-few-resources-to-ensure-the-newly-homeless-dont-become-the-chronically-homeless/"  target="_blank">dearth of funding for programs that might help newly homeless people</a>, or keep them from becoming homeless in the first place.</p>
<p>At 1 p.m. Monday at Golden Hall, the City Council is holding a town hall on homelessness. New data and program proposals related to San Diego&#8217;s newly homeless folks are expected to be among the topics discussed.</p>
<p>Halverstadt zeroes in on the issue and talks to people like Sue Lindsay, who was hired to help the Regional Task Force on the Homeless.</p>
<p>“We need prevention and diversion in this town, and we need it now,” Lindsay said.</p>
<p><em><strong>•</strong></em><strong> </strong>In a new op-ed for Voice of San Diego, Tom Theisen, a  past president of the Regional Task Force on the Homeless and a longtime volunteer for San Diego’s homeless, says there&#8217;s another homeless population San Diego county and city leaders need to target if they want to move the needle on the persistent homeless problem: <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/opinion/quick-fixes-wont-work-san-diegos-disabled-homeless-population/"  target="_blank">disabled residents who have lived on the streets for years</a>. Theisen says affordable housing coupled with services is the only way to successfully get San Diego&#8217;s disabled residents off the street for good.</p>
<h2>Details on Trump&#8217;s &#8216;Big, Beautiful Wall&#8217;</h2>
<p>Late Friday, new contract notices <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2017/03/18/us/politics/ap-us-border-wall.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >detailing the Trump administration&#8217;s proposed border wall</a> were posted by Customs and Border Protection.</p>
<p>The Associated Press reports that the wall must be 30-feet-high and built solidly so that it would take at least an hour to bust through with a &#8220;sledgehammer, car jack, pick axe, chisel, battery operated impact tools, battery operated cutting tools, Oxy/acetylene torch or other similar hand-held tools,&#8221; according to the notices.</p>
<p>San Diego will play a big role in the eventual building of the border wall. The AP says the government will award the final contract based on 30-foot sample walls that will be built here.</p>
<h2>Low-Income Renters Out of Luck</h2>
<p>In his State of the City address, Mayor Kevin Faulconer <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/government/one-term-in-faulconer-hasnt-moved-the-needle-much-on-new-housing/"  target="_blank">talked a lot about housing</a> and the region&#8217;s great need for more of it.</p>
<p>Affordable housing is something Faulconer and other local leaders talk a lot about, but a new study found that San Diego County is among the top three California counties to lose the most low-income homes over the past two decades.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/data-watch/sd-me-affordable-housing-20170318-story.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >The U-T analyzes the report</a>, which also found that San Diego County is on track to lose about 2,400 more subsidized rentals by 2022 thanks to soon-to-expire affordability protections.</p>
<h2>Faulconer Is Faulconering the SoccerCity Deal</h2>
<p>When it comes to big civic issues, Mayor Kevin Faulconer has become known for waiting in the wings until the political waters are warm enough for him to come out with an opinion. That&#8217;s what he did with his last-minute endorsement of the Chargers&#8217; failed pitch to build a new downtown stadium.</p>
<p>Faulconer has remained on the sidelines when it comes to SoccerCity, the proposal to transform the Qualcomm Stadium site into a new joint-use stadium surrounded by an entertainment district, housing and a public park.</p>
<p>But the U-T&#8217;s Kevin Acee says the mayor is <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sports/columnists/kevin-acee/sd-sp-aceesdsu-0319-story.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >taking a big step toward his expected endorsement</a> of the plan. On Tuesday, Faulconer is scheduled to meet with SDSU representatives and the group of investors behind the SoccerCity redevelopment plan.</p>
<p>Acee says the meeting will likely focus on addressing SDSU&#8217;s concerns with the project and adding some city-mandated provisions to the plan.</p>
<h2>Weekend News Roundup</h2>
<p><em><strong>•</strong></em> On this week&#8217;s Politically Speaking, NBC 7&#8217;s Gene Cubbison talked to Sen. Toni Atkins about her <a href="http://www.nbcsandiego.com/on-air/as-seen-on/POLY-SPEAK-WEB-3_17_17_SEG1_San-Diego-416446264.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >affordable housing bill</a>, and he interviewed the <a href="http://www.nbcsandiego.com/on-air/as-seen-on/POLY-SPEAK-WEB-3_17_17_SEG2_San-Diego-416446254.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >newest member of the San Diego County Board of Supervisors, Kristin Gaspar</a>.</p>

The Reader explains <a href="http://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2017/mar/18/beer-news-ballast-point-surpasses-stone/"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >the two big shifts</a>.</p>
<p><em><strong>• </strong></em>The U-T&#8217;s Greg Moran says the latest indictment in a Navy corruption scandal &#8220;<a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/courts/sd-me-leonard-indictment-20170316-story.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >depicts a wider and more coordinated effort</a>&#8221; by both Navy officers and Leonard Glenn Francis — aka “Fat Leonard.&#8221; Moran recounts incidents that show the big favors officers did for the contractor who&#8217;s admitted to defrauding the Navy of at least $35 million.</p>
<p><em><strong>• </strong></em>Reps. Darrell Issa and Duncan Hunter faced the same sort of angry crowds last week at town hall meetings, but the politicians had very different ways of handling the hostile questions.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez Fletcher has unveiled the details of her plan to reform SANDAG.</p>
<p>But her bill, AB 805, wouldn’t just make changes at the regional planning agency that’s embroiled in a scandal. Voice of San Diego revealed the agency asked the public for a tax increase and wildly overestimated how much money it would bring in – even though the agency knew about the numbers long before it disclosed them to the public.</p>
<p>Gonzalez Fletcher’s bill would also make San Diego’s mayor far more powerful, <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/government/gonzalez-bill-reform-sandag-make-san-diegos-mayor-way-powerful/" >as I wrote in a new story Friday</a>.</p>
<p>The bill would make the mayors of the county’s two largest cities – San Diego and Chula Vista – the chair and vice-chair of SANDAG. They would alternate the roles. It would also make San Diego’s mayor the chair of the Metropolitan Transit System, the region’s largest transit operator.</p>
<p>That’s in addition to bringing in a new independent auditor for the agency, allowing MTS to levy its own taxes and changing the voting structure at the agency to give more sway to the county’s largest cities, instead of giving each city on the board a vote of the same weight.</p>
<p>“What’s been happening hasn’t produced a result that anyone who cares about transportation funding can be happy with,” Gonzalez Fletcher said.</p>
<h2>Sacramento Report: Lawmakers Go Another Round With Human Trafficking</h2>
<p>Lawmakers last year passed a slew of new laws to combat human trafficking – and the bills floating around the Capitol this year show they aren’t done taking on the problem yet.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/must-reads/sacramento-report-taking-human-trafficking-round-2/" >As Sara Libby covers in this week’s Sacramento Report</a>, San Diego legislators have five bills looking to combat human trafficking.</p>
<p>State Sen. Toni Atkins has bills that would create a foster family placement system for child victims, a bill that would let prosecutors treat offenders’ records the way they treat other sex crimes and another that would require hotel and motel employees to undergo training to identify signs of the crime.</p>
<p>Gonzalez Fletcher has a bill that would make it easier for victims to recover lost income from the state. And Assemblyman Brian Maienschein has a bill that would let victims and prosecutors to sue both Johns and pimps in civil court for up to $10,000 per unlawful act.</p>
<p>In other Sacramento news, a Riverside lawmaker is looking to close a particular popular loophole in the state’s landmark environmental law, and we’ve got more details on Gonzalez Fletcher’s SANDAG bill.</p>
<h2>Reining in the Mid-Coast Trolley’s Rapidly Escalating Price Tag</h2>
<p>One project SANDAG expects to finish in the next few years is a trolley extension from Old Town to UTC, mostly along the Morena Boulevard corridor. It’s called the Mid-Coast extension.</p>
<p>But that 11-mile project is now estimated to cost over $2 billion— up from estimates of $1.2 billion just seven years ago. At its current ridership estimates, that would come down to spending about $60,000 per weekday rider by 2030; a recent rail line in L.A. would cost about $40,000 per rider by the same time.</p>
<p>In a new story, transit writer Alon Levy <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/government/change-rein-costs-wildly-expensive-mid-coast-trolley-project/"  target="_blank">proposes a way to rein in those costs</a>: a German invention called a tram-train. It would use light-rail vehicles but run them on existing mainline rail tracks (like the Coaster) so SANDAG wouldn’t need to build a new rail line along much of the trolley route.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, I also <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/land-use/residents-get-ready-to-rip-another-new-trolley-stop-density-plan/" >wrote about the city’s plans to increase development</a> along the route to take advantage of the transit investment – a plan that’s already facing stiff opposition from area residents.</p>
<h2>VOSD Podcast: Vacation Rentals Are Now Illegal in San Diego</h2>
<p>City Attorney Mara Elliott came out this week with an unequivocal change to the city’s interpretation of its own laws: whole-home short-term vacation rentals are illegal.</p>
<p>Councilman Chris Cate, who for a few years has been pushing a city proposal to maintain such rentals while addressing some of the community’s concerns with them,<a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/news/vosd-podcast-16/"  target="_blank"> joined me and Scott Lewis on the podcast this week</a> to share his reaction to the news. Elliott said she was too busy to make it on the show.</p>
<p>Gonzalez Fletcher also joined the show to share her motivation for proposing such drastic SANDAG reforms, and what she hopes to accomplish with her specific proposals.</p>
<h2>Opinion: How the Public Can Get Some Answers on SoccerCity</h2>
<p>San Diego residents will soon be asked – and asked again, and again – to sign a petition that could eventually greenlight development of Qualcomm Stadium into homes, a river park, office space and a smaller stadium that could house an MLS expansion team.</p>
<p>Once the investors behind the project have enough signatures, it’ll go to the City Council, which could approve it outright.</p>
<p>In a new op-ed, Kim John Kilkenny – former chair of San Diego’s downtown redevelopment agency – <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/opinion/heres-public-can-get-answers-soccercity-window-input-closes/"  target="_blank">argues that it&#8217;s crucial the public understands the deal now</a>, because it might not get another chance to weigh in.</p>
<p>Kilkenny is savvy and experienced in development, and he says he still has a lot of questions on the deal. That’s after spending an hour and a half asking the developers questions.</p>
<p>He’s got a proposal. Someone should create an online forum for developers to answer questions (he starts with 54 of them), the city should start holding public workshops, the mayor should direct the city to launch its own project analysis and the city should draft what would become the long-term lease now, before anything is approved.</p>
<h2>In Other News</h2>
<p><strong>•</strong> A federal jury ruled Friday that <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/courts/sd-me-ortega-verdict-20170317-story.html"  target="_blank"  >a San Diego officer’s use of force was reasonable</a> when he shot and killed Victor Ortega, a domestic violence suspect, during a struggle in Mira Mesa in 2012. (San Diego Union-Tribune)</p>
<p>In a story for us two years ago, <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/public-safety/san-diego-police-struggle-to-explain-killing-unarmed-man-in-mira-mesa/" >Kelly Davis covered how a federal judge had expressed doubt</a> about the officer’s official story about how the struggle played out and why deadly force was needed.</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> State officials think lobbyists for a division of Sempra Energy <a href="http://www.kpbs.org/news/2017/mar/17/san-diego-elected-officials-sempra-services-lobby/"  target="_blank"  >may have broken the law</a> when they met with San Diego elected officials over community choice energy – a program that would give the city the power to buy the energy we all use in our homes. The idea is that city officials could then choose to buy more renewable energy than SDG&amp;E would, lowering the city’s carbon footprint. (KPBS)</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/climate-action-plan/a-definitive-guide-to-community-choice-aggregation-and-whether-san-diego-will-do-it/" >Ry Rivard dove in with an explainer</a> on how the system is meant to work, what some of its critics think might be a problem and how the fight to get it approved is playing out.</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> County Supervisor Kristin Gaspar, unlike her fellow supervisors, voted against giving herself a $19,000 raise earlier this year. But that won’t stop her from taking the raise now that it’s been approved, <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/watchdog/sd-me-gaspar-raise-20170317-story.html"  target="_blank"  >as the San Diego Union-Tribune’s Jeff McDonald reports</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When the blizzard of layoff slips hit schools, it&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/education/why-district-layoffs-hit-poor-schools-the-hardest/"  target="_blank">poorest schools that are buried under the most pink</a>. That&#8217;s the logical end of a system that decides which teachers to lay off first using only one metric: how long has a teacher been employed. &#8220;It goes back to longstanding but controversial state law that requires school districts to first lay off its newest teachers before cutting those with more seniority,&#8221; Mario Koran reports. Poorer schools employ mostly new teachers, since teaching jobs at those schools are less sought-after.</p>
<p>So-called last in, first out layoffs can result in nearly every teacher at some poorer schools receiving a layoff notice. In 2011, 25 of 27 teachers at Fay Elementary in City Heights received layoff notices. In 2012, 1,372 teachers were laid off before negotiations got them all back in the classroom.</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> In the most recent episode of Good Schools for All, VOSD&#8217;s education podcast, Scott Lewis and Laura Kohn <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/education/finding-different-ways-of-learning/"  target="_blank">talked to David Miyashiro</a>, superintendent of Cajon Valley Union School District, about the success that district is having with personalized learning.</p>
<h2>Desal Distraction</h2>
<p>With yet another massive sewage spill out of Tijuana&#8217;s sewer system flooding into the Tijuana River, one San Diego water official is trying to draw Mexican government attention <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/science-environment/top-sd-water-official-wants-tijuana-to-prioritize-sewer-water-over-desal-water/"  target="_blank">away from desalination and onto repairing their sewers</a>. San Diego Regional Water Quality Control Board Executive Director David Gibson is warning the focus on getting a desalination effort done &#8220;could effectively limit or even preclude funding for sewer system improvements in coming years,&#8221; Ry Rivard reports.</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> President Donald Trump proposed budget <a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-budget-california-20170315-story.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >doesn&#8217;t look good</a> for programs aimed at fixing sewer problems at the border. (L.A. Times)</p>
<h2>Water Tunnels: San Diego Explained</h2>
<p>Southern California is dependent on neighbors to keep the water flowing. Some of our water comes from the east; a whole bunch of it comes from Northern California. Gov. Jerry Brown has proposed a project that would <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/podcasts-products/sandiego-explained/san-diego-explained-27/"  target="_blank">put pipelines underground to carry water</a> from the north to our region, but that&#8217;s an old idea whose friends have turned skeptical. Ry Rivard and NBC 7&#8217;s Monica Dean dive in to the issue in our most recent San Diego Explained.</p>
<h2>Get Activated</h2>
<p>Are you itching to get involved in a civic effort, public debate or to advocate for a cause? There are a lot of wrong ways to go about getting involved, but Adriana Heldiz lays out a <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/politics/six-ways-to-get-engages-in-local-politics/"  target="_blank">few of the ways that are proven to work</a>. &#8220;There’s more to effective involvement than just showing up,&#8221; Heldiz writes. It helps to connect with others, and to have a clear message to deliver to those who are listening. Some of the best tips involve leveraging local media outlets, and organizing with others. &#8220;Advocates can often find themselves alone on an issue, so they need to stay dedicated until others start paying attention,&#8221; Heldiz writes.</p>
<h2>More on That Trump Budget</h2>
<p>In what some <a href="http://www.marketplace.org/2017/03/16/business/trump-s-opening-salvo-budget-wars"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >described</a> as a really long tweet, President Donald Trump on Thursday unveiled the broad strokes of some changes he&#8217;d like to make in the federal budget. <a href="http://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/Trumps-Proposed-Spending-Plans-Generous-to-Military-Border-Needs-416389553.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >San Diego may fare very well</a> if the proposed military spending comes to pass, NBC 7 reports.

<h2>Bond Projects Questioned</h2>
<p>A community college bond measure passed by voters in 2006 unlocked $860 million to spend at local institutions, but concerns are once again being raised <a href="http://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/Teacher-Students-Voice-Concerns-With-How-City-College-Is-Spending-Part-Of-Voter-Approved-870-Million-Bond-416358613.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >over how the money has been spent</a>. NBC 7&#8217;s JW August reports one department chair recently resigned over lack of response to her concerns about numerous problems with work being done. The committee charged with overseeing bond expenditures &#8220;cited the most recent audit report and explained for the fifth year in a row, they have received a perfect audit,&#8221; August reports.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There’s a new city attorney in town and on Wednesday, she declared that she’s taking a different view than her predecessor on short-term vacation rentals.</p>
<p>In a new<a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/342019925/City-Attorney-Mara-Elliott-Short-term-rentals-not-allowed-per-city-code"  target="_blank"  > memo</a>, City Attorney Mara Elliott wrote that current city rules don’t allow short-term rentals (i.e., Airbnb) in neighborhoods whether they’re residential or commercial. Short-term rentals aren’t detailed in city code and thus aren’t allowed, Elliott wrote following a request from City Councilwoman Barbara Bry.</p>
<p>Ex-City Attorney Jan Goldsmith had <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/government/fact-check-is-sherri-lightner-really-proposing-a-ban-on-airbnb/" >previously emphasized</a> the vagueness of the city code and said the City Council should make policy moves if it wants to regulate short-term rentals. Indeed, the City Council’s smart growth committee is set to hear new proposed regulations for short-term rentals later this month.</p>
<p>Airbnb agrees with the need for an update: &#8220;The portion of the code referenced was not written with the sharing economy in mind and underscores why we need thoughtful, sensible short term rental regulations,&#8221; Jasmine Mora, a spokeswoman for the company, said in <a href="https://twitter.com/LisaHalverstadt/status/842184709945802752"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >a statement</a>.</p>
<p>Elliott’s memo doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean a crackdown on short-term rentals is imminent. A key city permitting official has <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/government/city-officials-noise-complaints-only-recourse-for-bad-vacation-rentals/" >previously said</a> city code also doesn’t give code officers tools to crack down in the first place.</p>
<p>Elliott acknowledged her memo doesn’t “allow the reasonable compromise our communities seek.”</p>
<p>An attempt late last year by then-City Councilwoman Sherri Lightner to ban Airbnb was roundly rejected.</p>
<p>— <em>Lisa Halverstadt</em></p>
<h2>Neighbors Confront Another Density Plan</h2>
<p>Once again, residents in San Diego&#8217;s Clairemont-adjacent Bay Park neighborhood are gearing up to confront a city plan to build new homes around a trolley station. Last time this happened, the city backed down in the face of acrid opposition instead of holding firm to its commitment to promote transit and density.</p>
<p>But this may not be a case of second verse, same as the first. This time, the plan is for increased density in nearby Linda Vista, although an Bay Park activist says his folks are ready to fight again for their neighboring community. And while the issues are similar, a developer says there seems to be more concern about building heights and view-blocking high rises this time around.</p>
<p>And there&#8217;s the matter of a citywide Climate Action Plan that&#8217;s gotten positive national attention and supports dense development. &#8220;In the past, there’s been an unspoken but widely understood pact with the city: The planning department doesn’t move forward with a new community plan unless it has the community’s support,&#8221; our Andrew Keatts writes in <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/land-use/residents-get-ready-to-rip-another-new-trolley-stop-density-plan/"  target="_blank">a story about the debate and the project&#8217;s prospects</a>. &#8220;That often means tempering opportunities for growth, but it helps shield elected officials from choosing between what planners says is best, and what the community says it would prefer. That may no longer be the case.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Can S.D. Unified Outsource Its Internal Watchdog?</h2>
<p>For more than four decades, San Diego Unified has had an internal audit office that acts as a kind of financial watchdog. The school district is now cutting funding for the office but plans to hire out when needed to get better access to specialists.</p>
<p>Whether this is a good idea or not, our Ashly McGlone reports that <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/education/state-outsourcing-law-complicate-san-diego-unifieds-plan-kill-internal-audit-office/"  target="_blank">the plan may not pass muster with a state law</a> that makes it difficult for school districts to outsource jobs. The district&#8217;s general counsel said the plan is legally sound, but the district wouldn&#8217;t provide any supporting documents to show it&#8217;s taken steps to comply with the law.</p>
<h2>City Brass Fend Off 911 Claims</h2>
<p>&#8220;San Diego Fire-Rescue Chief Brian Fennessy and other city officials <a href="http://www.10news.com/news/san-diego-fire-rescue-officials-defend-new-dispatch-system-dispute-lifeguard-unions-claims"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >worked Wednesday to refute claims</a> that changes to dispatching procedures that route inland water rescue calls to the fire department instead of directly to lifeguards delay responses and cause confusion,&#8221; City News Service reports via 10News.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a dispute between the city and the lifeguard union president over whether the response to an emergency involving a drowning child over the weekend was delayed.</p>
<h2>Not So Fast, SoccerCity Project?</h2>
<p>The L.A. Times says new state legislation aims to <a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-sac-megaprojects-ban-approval-20170315-story.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >make it more difficult</a> for projects like the proposed SoccerCity in Mission Valley to bypass environmental rules. The bill &#8220;bans local governments from approving such projects outright, while forcing developers to pay the cost of any special election.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> The Chargers are gone and a soccer team is uncertain, but at least we still have the &#8230; Oh dear. According to FiveThirtyEight, forecasters all agree that the Padres are going to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-nl-west-is-all-about-the-dodgers-and-giants/"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >stink up the National League West this year</a>, pulling up the rear, big-time, behind the four other teams.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s hard for me to knock the Padres, though, because their ballpark food is so great,&#8221; says Molly Knight, author of &#8220;The Best Team Money Can Buy.&#8221; &#8220;They even have beer garden days. And the crowds are so chill. It’s the most relaxing atmosphere in sports. But, yeah, they’re going to be ril bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>O RILY? Yes. Rily. Whether that&#8217;s a typo or not, I&#8217;m really adding ril to my vocabulary.</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> Ryan Leaf, the onetime Chargers star hopeful whose life and career hit rock bottom, has resurfaced as <a href="http://www.latimes.com/sports/nfl/la-sp-ryan-leaf-20170311-story.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >a cautionary tale</a>. &#8220;He’s now the program ambassador for Transcend Recovery Community, a sober-living environment with nine homes in the Los Angeles, New York and Houston areas,&#8221; the L.A. Times reports. He&#8217;s married and expecting his first child.</p>
<h2>New Report Card for School Districts</h2>
<p>The state has a new report card for school districts, but it&#8217;s not a simple matter of A-F grades. Instead, they&#8217;re &#8220;very high,&#8221; &#8220;high,&#8221; &#8220;medium,&#8221; &#8220;low,&#8221; or &#8220;very low,&#8221; which sounds a whole lot like A, B, C, D and F, but don&#8217;t you dare think that way.</p>
<p>San Diego Unified &#8220;<a href="http://www.kpbs.org/news/2017/mar/15/san-diego-schools-kick-off-new-performance/"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >achieved the &#8216;green&#8217; level, which is the second highest level and the state target</a>, on four of the five indicators — suspension rate, graduation rate, English language arts, and mathematics. On the fifth indicator, English learner progress, the district mark was &#8216;yellow,&#8217; or median performance,&#8221; reports KPBS.</p>
<p>Median, by the way, doesn&#8217;t mean &#8220;mean&#8221; (or average).</p>
<p>San Diego-area Assemblywoman Shirley Weber proposed a more rigorous school accountability system last year, but state officials went with this one.</p>
<h2>North County Report: Inside the Town Hall Anger-Fests</h2>
<p>This week&#8217;s <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/news/north-county-report-town-halls-long-anger-short-local-issues/"  target="_blank">VOSD North County Report</a> leads off with reports about the local town halls that are bedeviling our two local Republican congressmen, Reps. Darrell Issa and Duncan Hunter: Issa is being careful (perhaps not coincidentally, he&#8217;s endangered). Hunter, who&#8217;s not so endangered, is blowing off his critics, accusing them of being sore losers. Also: We have an explanation about how one of Issa&#8217;s 2018 foes managed to get a prime spot to ask questions at a town hall, a feat that made his own Democratic opponent get a bit grumbly.</p>
<p>Plus: Cities ponder putting homes in odd places (like a business park and next to a mission), a developer thinks Del Mar could use another resort and Encinitas is encountering some catastrophic thinking over a &#8220;pavement failure.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Quick News Hits: This Caller&#8217;s in a Fog</h2>
<p><strong>•</strong> KPBS profiles <a href="http://www.kpbs.org/news/2017/mar/15/new-voices-younger-generations-urgent-quest-change/"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >six emerging leaders</a> in the historically black and low-income neighborhoods of southeastern San Diego. The region&#8217;s unemployment rate was nearly three times that of the rest of the city last year, KPBS said, and the percentage of households on food stamps is almost double.</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> The county Board of Supervisors is <a href="https://issa.house.gov/sites/issa.house.gov/files/H.R.%20474%20Issa%20Letter.pdf"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >supporting Rep. Darrell Issa&#8217;s plan</a> to <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/business/energy-green/sd-fi-issa-nukewaste-20170118-story.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >move nuclear waste away</a> from the closed San Onofre power plant. As the U-T has reported, &#8220;there is no clear path to move the waste somewhere else,&#8221; although legislation could change that.</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> If you feel like there aren&#8217;t enough places to listen to music in the county, then this may sound like a great idea: The county fairgrounds <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/communities/north-county/sd-no-race-place-20170315-story.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >may build a concert venue for up to $13 million</a>. According to the U-T, the fairground&#8217;s board approved looking into loan options by a vote of 7-1; the dissenter was miffed because the only written material in support was two sentences in an agenda.</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> And now <a href="https://twitter.com/SanDiegoScanner/status/841541277099343872"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >a slice of San Diego life from the police scanner</a>. The other day, someone called &#8220;about alarm going off every 10 mins or something for like 10 seconds for past 2 hrs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Response: &#8220;It&#8217;ll be the foghorn on the pier &#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Hmm. Was it a watercraft protection device or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foghorn_Leghorn"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >a rooster named Leghorn?</a> We may never know &#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Bay, home to some of the county&#8217;s poorest and most diverse neighborhoods, hardly sounded like prime pickings to the pioneers of the local craft beer boom. By the end of 2015, just two of 114 area breweries and brewpubs had opened in the region.</p>
<p>Brewers and distributors, it seems, just assumed that the residents preferred their beer to be in non-elite cans and bottles instead of growlers — Bud Light, Corona, Dos Equis, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>But things are changing as brewers have flocked to Chula Vista, National City and Imperial Beach. It&#8217;s a &#8220;<a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/food/south-bays-craft-beer-boom-upending-assumptions/"  target="_blank">mini craft beer boom</a>,&#8221; writes VOSD contributor Jonah Valdez, who explores the suddenly-suds situation in a new story.</p>
<p>Many of the business owners behind the new openings resent the assumptions that have held craft beer back in the South Bay.</p>
<p>“The biggest hurdle has been the perception that the South Bay either didn’t want [craft beer], wasn’t ready for it, or didn’t have the market for it,” Eddie Trejo, co-owner of Machete Beer House in National City told Valez. “All these misguided perceptions: It’s low-income; there is mostly Mexicans and Filipinos; they don’t want [craft beer].”</p>
<p><strong>• </strong>No, New York Times, we don&#8217;t call it &#8220;the Pacific Beach,&#8221; and it sounds weird to describe Miramar as a &#8220;neighborhood.&#8221; Other than that, thanks for the shout-out from the Frugal Traveler about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/14/travel/san-diego-beer-budget-travel.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Flucas-peterson&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=undefined&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=collection"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >our sights and suds</a>: In addition to great beer, he writes, we&#8217;re also home to &#8220;great nightlife, scenic cliffside hikes, and boardwalks and beaches as welcoming as you will find anywhere in the country.&#8221; (Where are the <em>unwelcoming</em> beaches and boardwalks? Spill, NYT!)</p>
<p>The writer heard Trump fans chat it up at a local bar, listened to his cousin complain about &#8220;the aggressive men who don’t respect women&#8221; in the Gaslamp Quarter, and visited North Park where &#8220;the glut of beer and breweries is almost overwhelming.&#8221; (Almost?) He also met an ancient parrot named Dry Rot in Pacific Beach and saw a 1970s-era mural in Chicano Park with modern relevance: &#8220;Varrio si, yonkes no!” (Neighborhood yes, junkyards no!)</p>
<h2>Picture It: Socceravaganza!</h2>
<p>Hey look, we have <a href="http://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/New-Image-Soccer-Football-Stadium-Project-San-Diego-Mission-Valley-416144373.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >an artist&#8217;s renderings</a> (you know, those drawings where the sky always looks magnificent) of the proposed Soccer City project in Mission Valley. This time, the wind is attractively blowing clouds around.</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> The latest episode of <a href="http://www.keptfaith.com/uncategorized/abby-hamblin-ut-ideas-tkf-pod-82/"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >Kept Faith</a>, the local sports podcast that&#8217;s part of the VOSD podcast network, features a chat with the Union-Tribune&#8217;s Abby Hamblin about the Padres, the World Baseball Classic in our fair city and the NCAA Tournament.</p>
<p>Also: A look back at 1994&#8217;s &#8220;Angels in the Outfield,&#8221; which did not (thankfully) include Gary Coleman <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CVLxaJiUEAIPvq0.jpg"  target="_blank"  target="_blank"  data-rel="lightbox-0" data-imagelightbox="0" title="">portraying the kid manager of the Padres</a>. That was a different movie, one on TV back in 1979.</p>
<p>Fun Fact: According to the book &#8220;<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=mksHDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT295&amp;lpg=PT295&amp;dq=gary+coleman+padres&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pDqFTD7sLN&amp;sig=nVzeVD7NQpkFm-gID__8VPamuJM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwju9tHvo9fSAhVHjFQKHdQgA-8Q6AEIXjAN#v=onepage&amp;q=gary%20coleman%20padres&amp;f=false"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >100 Things Padres Fans Should Know &amp; Do Before They Die</a>,&#8221; the Padres hired sportscaster <a href="https://the5point5holedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/jerry-coleman-lulac-archives.jpg"  target="_blank"  target="_blank"  data-rel="lightbox-1" data-imagelightbox="1" title="">Jerry &#8220;You Can Hang a Star on That One, Baby!&#8221; Coleman</a> the day after &#8220;The Kid from Left Field&#8221; aired in 1979. One wit joked that then-Padres owner Ray Kroc had been misunderstood when he demanded that <em>Gary</em> Coleman be hired.</p>
<h2>Dems Won&#8217;t Boot Union Leader</h2>
<p>Powerful local union leader Mickey Kasparian, who&#8217;s facing widespread criticism amid a series of lawsuits alleging workplace and sexual misconduct, <a href="http://timesofsandiego.com/politics/2017/03/14/kasparian-keeps-seat-on-san-diego-dems-central-committee/"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >will remain on the local Democratic Party&#8217;s Central Committee</a>. According to Times of San Diego, the committee&#8217;s 11-member executive board couldn&#8217;t reach the two-thirds vote needed to remove him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Last month, close to four dozen Democrats and activists sent a letter to the local and state Democratic Party and two labor groups calling for an investigation of Kasparian and having him step aside in the interim,&#8221; Times of S.D. reports.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/news/everything-we-know-about-the-lawsuits-facing-labor-chief/"  target="_blank">examined the allegations against Kasparian,</a> an important and influential power player in local Democratic politics.</p>
<h2>Politics Roundup: No Pot to Buy?</h2>
<p>The County Board of Supervisors will vote today on whether to <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/ramona-sentinel/news/local-news/sd-cm-ram-advance-supervisors-pot-ban-20170314-story.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >ban the commercial farming and sale of marijuana</a> in unincorporated areas, a huge if not especially well-populated swath of the county. Unincorporated areas include towns like Ramona, Bonsall, Fallbrook, Lakeside and many others. About 492,000 of the county&#8217;s 3.2 million people live in these areas, according to 2013 numbers.</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> Federal investigators are <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/watchdog/sd-me-fec-applegate-20170314-story.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >trying to figure out where $400,000 in campaign funds went</a> during Democrat Doug Applegate&#8217;s nearly successful bid to topple Rep. Darrell Issa in North County. (U-T)</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> State Sen. Pat Bates is perhaps the most obscure local legislator, no surprise considering she mostly represents a chunk of Orange County and only a sliver of our North County. But now <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article138473063.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >she has a larger profile</a>: She&#8217;s been elected as the new leader of the state Senate&#8217;s Republican members — all 13 of them. The Dems have 27. (Sacramento Bee)</p>
<h2>Culture Report: Chronicling the Re-Rise of Meth</h2>
<p>San Diego, the onetime meth capital of the nation, still has a major meth problem. Now, a new play tries to bring home the message that the drug isn&#8217;t just a problem for other folks. “We have this perception that it only affected certain types of people and it kind of stayed in the East County, but now it really is everywhere and used by all kinds of people,” the play&#8217;s creator tells our arts editor Kinsee Morlan in this week&#8217;s <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/arts/culture-report-21/"  target="_blank">VOSD Culture Report</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;She said the interviews taught her that younger people who missed the more fervent anti-meth campaigns of past decades don’t think the drug is as gross and disgusting as older people do,&#8221; Morlan writes. &#8220;She also learned that a play directed at current meth users would be pointless — everyone she interviewed told her she had to target it toward kids who’d yet to even touch the drug.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also in the Culture Report: Inside binational lives, an end of an era for Space 4 Art (although it&#8217;s working on its next act), sonic experimentation and San Diego&#8217;s Jewish history. Plus: The San Diego Central Library allowed patrons to &#8220;check out&#8221; humans for 15-minute chats. I didn&#8217;t have a chance to borrow one and forget to bring it back for 35 years.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s a common refrain during school bond campaigns: Vote yes and we promise your money will go to construction projects, not district employees.</p>
<p>Turns out that’s not quite true.</p>
<p>Districts across California, including the San Diego Unified and Grossmont Union High school districts, <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/education/school-bond-money-can-used-employee-salaries/"  target="_blank">have openly been spending bond money on employee costs for more than a decade</a>, our Ashly McGlone reports.</p>
<p>In a new story, McGlone explains how a 2004 attorney general’s opinion opened the door to millions of dollars in bond cash bankrolling the salaries and pensions of certain school workers. The money can&#8217;t go to pay for, say, teachers&#8217; salaries — but it can be used to pay for the salaries and benefits of employees who oversee the bond projects.</p>
<p>This year alone, McGlone finds, San Diego Unified is expecting to throw $15 million in school bond cash at employee salaries and benefits. That puts it about in the middle of the pack compared to districts across the state.</p>
<p>Remember, there&#8217;s nothing illegal about spending bond money this way.</p>
<p>“Everybody states there will be no salaries going for administration. Some say teachers and administrators. It’s a big selling point, but that’s not true. But all the election people put it in because it sounds good,” one expert told McGlone of the ways in which districts sell bond measures to voters.</p>
<h2><strong>Lawmaker Pushes SANDAG Reform</strong></h2>
<p>SANDAG could be facing some major reforms out of Sacramento.</p>
<p>Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez Fletcher unveiled the details Monday of AB 805, <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/government/sacramento-report-state-lawmakers-eye-sandag-reforms/"  target="_blank">a bill she announced two weeks ago to make major changes to the regional planning agency</a>.</p>
<p>Most significantly, her bill would make shift the agency to a single vote weighted by population; right now, SANDAG also has a vote where each city in the county has a vote of equal weight (think of it like the House and Senate — one gives equal weight to all states, one is weighted by population). It would give the city of San Diego far greater sway in regional transportation decisions.<br />
It would also <a href="http://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/Spending-Reforms-Proposed-for-SANDAG-Following-Measure-As-Miscalculations-416073643.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >create an audit committee, and an independent auditor, to oversee the agency’s spending, forecasting and budgeting</a>.</p>
<p>The bill would also give the county’s two transit agencies – the North County Transit District and Metropolitan Transit System – the authority to levy taxes within their specific coverage areas. That would mean the more tax-friendly areas that are covered by MTS could impose their own tax, without having to rely on tax-averse North County for votes.</p>
<p>The proposed legislation follows our Andrew Keatts’ bombshell reporting that <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/government/omg-wtf-sandag-knew-its-forecasts-were-wrong-went-to-voters-with-false-promise-anyway-emails-show/" >revealed the agency pushed faulty estimates</a> as it campaigned for a transportation measure rejected by voters last fall. The SANDAG board recently <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/government/sandag-approves-investigation-into-forecasting-scandal/" >approved an independent investigation</a> of the debacle.</p>
<h2><strong>On the Border Beat</strong></h2>
<p>As President Donald Trump proudly pushes his border wall plans, San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer is touting our city’s border connection.</p>
<p>Faulconer and Tijuana Mayor Juan Manuel Gastélum met at Tijuana’s Casa de la Cultura Monday to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/kevinfaulconer/videos/1381351291927077/?hc_ref=NEWSFEED"  target="_blank"  >sign a formal pledge</a> to team on economic development and other civic causes.</p>
<p>Faulconer has repeatedly <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/politics/sd-me-faulconer-border-20170125-story.html"  target="_blank"  >emphasized San Diego’s cross-border business ties</a> as Trump calls for immigration and border crackdowns.</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> Baja farm workers who help supply a significant share of U.S. fruits and veggies aretraveling across Mexico this month to spotlight their harsh working conditions. VOSD contributor Brooke Binkowski <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/news/border-report-bajas-farm-laborers-demand-better-treatment/"  target="_blank">shares their story and rounds up news on Trump’s latest moves to ramp up immigration enforcement</a>, the infamous Tijuana River sewage spill and more in the latest Border Report.</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> A state bill that aims to make California a sanctuary for undocumented <a href="http://www.kpbs.org/news/2017/mar/13/california-immigration-measure-amended-heads-senat/"  target="_blank"  >immigrants moved forward Monday</a> with some tweaks and the state has officially <a href="http://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/California-President-Donald-Trump-Travel-Ban-416044383.html"  target="_blank"  >joined the legal fight</a> against Trump’s updated travel ban, the Associated Press reports. San Diego Sen. Ben Hueso&#8217;s bill to <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/government/sacramento-report-high-profile-deportation-bill-gets-a-hard-look/"  target="_blank">fund legal representation for immigrants facing deportation</a> also moved forward Monday.</p>
<h2><strong>Unpopular Politics</strong></h2>
<p>The Union-Tribune reports that Rep. Darrell Issa, a big Trump supporter during the 2016 campaign, is backing away from the president this year following an internal <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/politics/sd-me-issa-poll-20170310-story.html"  target="_blank"  >poll that showed that support was hurting him politically</a> – and could make the Vista Republican’s next political race even more difficult.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not all kids can make it work at traditional public schools.</p>
<p>Those who can&#8217;t often find themselves enrolling at charter schools that offer online courses and independent study programs.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a mutually beneficial relationship between charter schools, which get new students and the state funding that follows them, and San Diego Unified School District, which sheds its lowest-performing students and boosts its graduation rates.</p>
<p>But as our Mario Koran reports, the district now wants to <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/education/san-diego-unified-wants-simultaneously-shut-mimic-online-charters/"  target="_blank">stop that flow of struggling students to online charters</a>.</p>
<p>San Diego Unified, along with Grossmont Union, are suing to shut down Diego Hills and its sister school, Diego Valley. The lawsuit says the schools are operating illegally in districts that didn’t give them permission to be there.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, San Diego Unified has gotten to work building out programs that mimic the same programs they want to shut down, in an effort to keep students and the government funding that follows them from leaving.</p>
<p>&#8220;The district is betting that if it expands its online programs, fewer students will leave for charter schools that offer flexible schedules and online courses,&#8221; Koran writes.</p>
<p>But Koran talks to a few online charter school students whose stories illustrate why that might be a losing bet.</p>
<h2>Town Halls Gone Wild</h2>
<p>People have been pushing hard to get Reps. Duncan Hunter and Darrell Issa to hold town hall meetings and answer mounting questions and concerns from constituents worried about health care, immigration and possible presidential ties to Russia.</p>
<p>On Saturday, both finally did and the <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/politics/sd-no-issa-meeting-20170310-story.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >events were rowdy and raucous</a>. (U-T)</p>
<p>You can<a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B60PSY_XSw-YczF3c3J4N3JTV1k"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" > listen to audio and see photos of Issa&#8217;s back-to-back town halls here </a>thanks to the local chapter of the Service Employees International Union, and here&#8217;s a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ginger.hitzke/videos/10210815275156980/?story_fbid=10210815275156980&amp;id=1204041652"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >Facebook video of Hunter&#8217;s event</a> (spoiler: Hunter brings up Queen&#8217;s &#8220;We Are the Champions&#8221; song multiple times, convinced those pushing back against him were just sore-loser Democrats.)</p>
<h2>Domestic Abuse Victims Offered Forensic Exams</h2>
<p>Thanks to a new grant, some domestic violence victims in San Diego County can now get <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/public-safety/sd-me-dv-exam-20170309-story.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >access to exams that provide valuable medical evidence</a> that could help put their abusers behind bars, reports the Union-Tribune.</p>
<p>Forensic exams for victims of sexual assault and child abuse have long been used to aid prosecutors. Performed by specially trained nurses, the exams can produce solid evidence in cases that are often hard to prove.</p>
<p>Now domestic abuse survivors will have access to those same exams, but when the grant money runs out, the program will go away unless local leaders see the new program&#8217;s value and step up to permanently fund it.</p>
<h2>More on San Diego Unified&#8217;s Coming Layoffs</h2>
<p>Those who will lose their jobs due to San Diego Unified&#8217;s budget shortfall will find out about their plights this week when pink slips go out on March 15.</p>
<p>Michael Smolens writes that the district shouldn&#8217;t give in to temptation and rescind some of the layoffs even if it ends up getting more money than expected from the state.</p>
<p>&#8220;San Diego Unified has gone down this path before, raining pink slips down on hundreds of employees only to withdraw most and sometimes all of the layoff threats,&#8221; writes Smolens.</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> Smolens cites 977 full-time positions as the number of district employees being laid off, but as VOSD&#8217;s Ashly McGlone reported, that number <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/education/1576-400-800-977-common-theyve-cited-districts-layoff-total/"  target="_blank">has been bouncing all over the place</a> in recent weeks.</p>

(U-T)</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> U-T columnist Dan McSwain doesn&#8217;t think the SoccerCity proposal to redevelop Mission Valley&#8217;s Qualcomm Stadium site is a con like some critics have claimed, but he also <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/business/columnists/dan-mcswain/sd-fi-soccer-stadium-weak-case-for-haste-mcswain-20170312-story.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >lists a few big caveats and concerns</a> about the plan.</p>

<p>I hesitated about driving to Borrego Springs on Sunday because I kept seeing posts from folks who said they&#8217;d gone and it was a dud. Well, I&#8217;m here to tell you it&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s bloom-tastic and the smells are just as grand as the sights. I do have to warn you about the traffic, though, because it&#8217;s bad (like, don&#8217;t even try going to the visitor center if you drive into town after 9 a.m.). What you can and should do is a lot of online research to figure out your general route. <a href="http://www.abdnha.org/pages/03flora/reports/current.htm"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >This website</a> helped me out. Also, a townie told me that the first week of April is the best weekend to go this year. I have no idea if that&#8217;s true.</p>
<p>IMO, it was worth the drive and the crowds just to see <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BRjRzm6Ag3U/"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >this one rad desert lily</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Breweries that invite catering companies to sell food to patrons are facing a county-wide crackdown that could make it harder for customers to drink on anything other than an empty stomach.</p>
<p>For years, pop-up caterers have helped drinkers get food with their beer at small breweries across San Diego. <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/food/get-harder-buy-food-local-brewery/" >But the county became concerned that the caterers were not following food safety rules</a>, freelancer Ian Anderson writes for us. For instance, about half of caterers did not have access to a hand-washing sink, according to a study of 25 locations.</p>
<p>Catering companies will now have to have a Direct-Sales Catering Permit, while tasting rooms need a newly-created Host Facility Permit.</p>
<p>Marilyn Morrison, owner of Emme’s Catering, said she was bothered by the new rules at first, but now recognizes the need.</p>
<p>“Too many folks have been running like it’s the wild west,” she said.</p>
<p>The new rules took effect in mid-January, but the county is offering a grace period until June. Then, Morrison and others will have to decide if they want to invest what could be thousands of dollars so their businesses qualify for the new permit.</p>
<h2>State Cracks Down on Big Beer</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/government/sacramento-report-state-regulators-crack-down-on-beer-distributor-scheme/" >In this week&#8217;s report about the many goings-on in Sacramento</a>, Andrew Keatts tells us how San Diego&#8217;s craft beer industry may be getting a boost from the state’s Alcohol and Beverage Control division. The agency now seems to be going after long-alleged pay-to-play tactics by big beer companies that make Budweiser, Coors and Miller. The theory is that these beer makers pay bars, restaurants or retailers to carry a specific brand of beer, and not its competitors &#8212; a practice that would hurt small breweries here and across the state.</p>
<p>I write about a how state lawmakers are taking another stab at a $3.5 billion bond for parks, the Salton Sea and other outdoorsy things. And Sara Libby tells us how a recent investigation by our friends at CalMatters shows insinuations of widespread voter fraud in California is a trumped-up charge, so to speak.</p>
<h2>Podcast: SANDAG&#8217;s Misleading Numbers Games</h2>
<p>The regional planning agency SANDAG hid two things as it tried to sell voters on a tax increase last year. It mislead us about how much money a previous tax increase was bringing in &#8212; an effort that seemed aimed to ensure that we didn&#8217;t realize the projects it was trying to entice us with might not happen. And, as we reported this week, the agency also misled us about how much its projects would actually cost &#8212; another trick with the same apparent goal.</p>
<p>Andrew Keatts, who has been investigating this over the past several months, <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/news/vosd-podcast-15/" >talks about his latest findings with Scott Lewis on this week&#8217;s podcast</a>, which they co-host.</p>
<p>• Speaking of this, SANDAG&#8217;s executive committee yesterday<a href="https://t.co/VBsWE3oS8E"  target="_blank"  > decided to ask for proposals from law firms </a>so that an outsider can investigate the agency.</p>
<p>Also on the podcast, Keatts and Lewis also talk about the plan to put a new joint-use football and soccer stadium in Mission Valley where Qualcomm Stadium now is. Their guests are Beau Lynott, who runs a website covering San Diego State Aztecs football, as well as Kirby Brady and Mark Cafferty of the San Diego Regional Economic Development Corporation.</p>
<h2>Commentary: Empty Lots and Lost Opportunities</h2>
<p>Everybody is focused on what should become of the Qualcomm Stadium site. But San Diegans should look at other vacant or underused spaces, too. Then we should consider what else might be possible, <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/opinion/hopeful-tale-san-diego-might-become/" >according to an op-ed by Clifford Deaton</a>, a political scientist who writes about urban development.</p>
<p>The most obvious example of this working is East Village’s Quartyard, a lot that has become a good place to grab a beer and meet friends. There are lots with similar potential across the city&#8217;s 342.4 square miles and most of them go unused. If neighborhoods focused as much on them as the city did on the feckless wants of a professional sports team that shall go unnamed, perhaps we&#8217;d all enjoy beautiful San Diego even more than we do now.</p>

<p>• The San Diego City Council is set to impose its own set of rules against drones used by hobbyists, even though there are existing federal rules that try to protect the public from drones. Some people feel the city&#8217;s proposed rules does not go far enough. “We’re talking about brain injuries, eyes getting put out — the bad stuff that happens and changes people’s lives forever,” local attorney Dan Gilleon <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/politics/sd-me-drone-regs-20170310-story.html"  target="_blank"  >tells the Union-Tribune&#8217;s David Garrick</a>, who has been covering the city&#8217;s drone rulemaking.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The city of San Diego has committed to getting 100 percent of electricity sold in the city from renewable sources by 2035. It&#8217;s city law.</p>
<p>But San Diego Gas and Electric isn&#8217;t committed to that. Thus, one way the city could achieve that goal is to take over the job of finding and purchasing the electricity sent to San Diego&#8217;s consumers. If the city and others in the region decide to do that, we could bestow upon our government the magical term &#8220;community choice aggregator.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yeah, it&#8217;s a mess of a term but you&#8217;re going to hear it a lot in coming years if you follow local politics. In a special and <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/climate-action-plan/a-definitive-guide-to-community-choice-aggregation-and-whether-san-diego-will-do-it/"  target="_blank">easy-to-read FAQ</a>, Ry Rivard explains what it means, what the city is committed to and why the decision would not mean the end of SDG&amp;E.</p>
<p>&#8220;Community choice actually means &#8216;government choice,'&#8221; Rivard explains. The city would take over the job of buying up electricity, theoretically from only renewable sources, but SDG&amp;E would still deliver it. You&#8217;d still get bills from SDG&amp;E. &#8220;Some customers might have no idea anything changed,&#8221; Rivard notes, if community choice aggregation was to happen.</p>
<p>San Diegans could get cleaner power out of the deal, but the elephant in the room is how much it would cost. &#8220;This is a big unknown,&#8221; Rivard writes.</p>
<h2>1,500 School Pink Slips After All</h2>
<p>Job cuts are coming to San Diego Unified School District. After initially not publishing any details of how many staff would be laid off, and then telling us our estimate of a looming 1,500 layoffs were &#8220;<a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/education/three-big-outstanding-questions-san-diego-unifieds-budget-cuts/"  target="_blank">wrong</a>,&#8221; the district fessed up recently and put a number to <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/education/1576-400-800-977-common-theyve-cited-districts-layoff-total/"  target="_blank">the layoffs they expect: 1,576</a>. We were off by only half of one percent.</p>
<p>But Ashly McGlone reports on how even the district&#8217;s own number of 1,576 can&#8217;t get traction. Trustee John Lee Evans &#8220;told Fox 5 just 400 to 500 positions would be cut,&#8221; McGlone reports. When Superintendent Cindy Marten was asked about 850 jobs being cut, she didn&#8217;t correct the interviewer. Another public document floating around specifies 891 jobs cut. &#8220;And so, the mystery continues,&#8221; McGlone writes, until April when the last of the pink slips are due to go out.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a chance that more teachers will choose early retirement options or more money will lessen the cuts. But a deficit is already projected for next year and Marten has said she&#8217;ll resist reinstating many people.</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> Teachers and other schools staff are starting <a href="http://fox5sandiego.com/2017/03/09/san-diego-unified-employees-begin-receiving-pink-slips/"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >to get the actual pink slips.</a></p>
<h2>Slow Train Coming: San Diego Explained</h2>
<p>While California continues with its ambitious goals to build high-speed trains throughout the state, San Diegans know better than to hold their breath. The first leg of that effort is still at least 12 years away and doesn&#8217;t come anywhere near San Diego. So while generations of San Diegans may come and go waiting for the bullet train to pull into the station, one thing we could do in a much shorter period of time would be to <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/news/san-diego-explained-routes-better-regional-train-system/"  target="_blank">make the trains we already have go much faster</a>. Andrew Keatts and NBC 7&#8217;s Monica Dean look into the corridor between San Diego and Los Angeles (one of the busiest in the country) and what it would take to bring trip times way down in our most recent San Diego Explained.</p>
<h2>Slow Changes at MTS</h2>
<p>After much coverage of their anemic options for payment, KPBS&#8217;s Andrew Bowen reports on how Metropolitan Transit System&#8217;s bus and trolley riders will soon be able to <a href="http://www.kpbs.org/news/2017/mar/09/mts-launching-mobile-ticketing-app-limits/"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >buy day passes using a smartphone app</a>. It&#8217;s among the earliest improvements MTS has made since they came under criticism that all of their payment methods were stuck in the 1980s. The new smartphone app will not be able to purchase single-trip fares when the app launches, although MTS says they are working on that. The app will also be able to purchase day passes on services run from the North County Transit District.</p>
<h2>Alright Fine, We&#8217;ll Listen</h2>
<p>After an extensive public outcry, Republican Rep. Darrel Issa and Rep. Duncan Hunter are finally <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/politics/sd-me-issa-lawsuit-20170309-story.html#nt=oft13a-1gp1"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >back in the mood to host town hall meetings</a>. The pair had previously decided the meetings weren&#8217;t a good idea at a time when the nation is facing upheaval on a variety of major policy issues such as immigration and health care. The meetings are expected to be packed, the Union-Tribune reports, but Issa is holding two consecutive meetings and is planning to livestream them on Facebook.</p>
<p>• Issa&#8217;s <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/politics/sd-me-issa-lawsuit-20170309-story.html#nt=oft13a-1gp1"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >$10 million defamation lawsuit</a> against his former opponent Doug Applegate has been preliminarily tossed by a judge. (Union-Tribune)</p>
<h2>Lightning Round</h2>
<p>• The <a href="http://timesofsandiego.com/tech/2017/03/09/traffic-25-faster-smart-rosecrans-signals/"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >largest use of new smart traffic signals</a> in the city is in Point Loma, reducing driving times by up to 25 percent. (Coincidentally, they&#8217;re installed on the road the mayor has to use to get home.) (Times of San Diego)</p>
<p>• The theater chain Cinepolis announced their Southern California theaters will start offering <a href="http://mashable.com/2017/03/09/cinepolis-junior-playground-movie-theater/#lWd612wF.8qT"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >dedicated children&#8217;s playground movie theaters</a> that include play time with a giant slide and kid-friendly seating. (Mashable)</p>
<p>• One California Supreme Court justice <a href="http://www.kpbs.org/news/2017/mar/09/justice-kathryn-werdegar-announces-retirement-cali/"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >announced her retirement</a> later this year. (KPBS)</p>
<p>• California legislator <a href="https://twitter.com/PhillipChenCA/status/839616757790736384"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >has impressive nunchuck skills</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Local business improvement districts — neighborhood coalitions that assess fees on businesses — have been worrying a lot about the homeless lately. But their approaches are far from identical.</p>
<p>As our Lisa Halverstadt reports, some are trying to help the homeless while others simply <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/nonprofits/business-districts-increasingly-combating-homelessness/"  target="_blank">want them to move along</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Security officers hired by business districts order homeless folks to leave storefronts in Hillcrest and Ocean Beach, while outreach workers offer help in City Heights and downtown neighborhoods,&#8221; she reports. &#8220;The approaches differ but the motivation behind the business groups’ efforts is consistent: There’s a need to better deal with homeless folks, and business groups can’t afford to wait for government officials to help.&#8221;</p>
<p>The executive director of a business coalition in Hillcrest is pretty blunt about the approach there: &#8220;We encourage them to go somewhere else through annoyance. We sort of do to homeless people what they do to our customers.”</p>
<h2>Eliot Hirshman, Out</h2>
<p>San Diego State University&#8217;s president, Eliot Hirshman, let it be known Wednesday that <a href="http://www.thedailyaztec.com/82023/news/president-hirshman-to-leave-sdsu/"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >he would be leaving his job</a> this summer to take the lead of a small school in Maryland called Stevenson University.</p>
<p>Apparently Stevenson used to be a &#8220;<a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/education/higher-ed/bs-md-stevenson-president-20170308-story.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >sleepy commuter school</a>&#8221; near Baltimore. In recent years, with a new name, it has grown significantly.</p>
<p>The timing is significant. While it is not at all unusual for a major university to lose its leader after six years, the move comes right as SDSU begins grappling with its most significant local political and land-use challenge in recent memory. University leaders are very interested in the future of the land under and around Qualcomm Stadium.</p>
<p>Yet without a new president, and with a lame-duck one on the way out, it&#8217;s hard to picture how the university will take a major role in the discussion until a transition is completed.</p>
<p>A U-T columnist warned yesterday that it was not clear at all where SDSU could play football in <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sports/columnists/kevin-acee/sd-sp-acee-0308-story.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >just a few years</a>. Signature gatherers will begin collecting support for the <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/land-use/how-soccercity-dies/"  target="_blank">SoccerCity plan</a> next week.</p>
<h2>Opinion: An Independent Probe Needed</h2>
<p>In <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/opinion/sandag-investigation-needs-truly-independent/"  target="_blank">a VOSD commentary</a>, two representatives of the left-leaning Quality of Life Coalition, which opposed the failed transit-oriented Measure A last November, blast the San Diego Association of Governments over its botched-projection scandal. &#8220;It is only through an exhaustive independent investigation with an investigator chosen by outside stakeholders, an apology issued by the board for deceiving San Diego families and meaningful reform to the agency’s governing structure that the agency can restore that trust,&#8221; they write.</p>
<h2>North County Report: Big Drug Bust</h2>
<p>This week&#8217;s <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/news/north-county-report-task-force-nabs-major-drug-gun-racket/"  target="_blank">VOSD North County Report</a> leads with news of a major drug bust that led to the arrests of 46 people linked to heroin and meth trafficking, among 55 people thought to be responsible for up to 25 percent of the heroin sold in North County.</p>
<p>Also: Rep. Duncan D. Hunter is veering from the Trumpian line on major Coast Guard cutbacks, the rural community of Bonsall is trying to figure out how to build a new high school after voters rejected a bond measure, and medical marijuana fans in Vista are going back to the drawing board.</p>
<p>• An environmental attorney from Orange County named Mike Levin has <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sd-me-levin-runs-20170308-story.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >announced his candidacy</a> to run against Rep. Darrell Issa, potentially complicating matters for Democrats who might hope for smooth sailing for fellow Democratic candidate Darrell Applegate, who came out of nowhere to near vanquish Issa in November, the U-T reports. Levin is the former head of the Democratic Party in Orange County.</p>
<h2>GOP Obamacare Replacement&#8217;s S.D. Effects</h2>
<p>Some San Diego County residents who get their insurance though the state Obamacare exchange, especially those with lower incomes, would <a href="http://kff.org/interactive/tax-credits-under-the-affordable-care-act-vs-replacement-proposal-interactive-map/?utm_campaign=KFF-2017-March-Tax-Credit-Maps&amp;utm_content=50341693&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >actually receive higher subsidies for coverage</a> under the new House plan, the Kaiser Family Foundation finds. For example, a 27-year-old who makes $30,000 would get a $2,000 credit in 2020 instead of $1,080 under Obamacare.</p>
<p>Recipients may need the more generous tax credits: Critics say the Republican replacement for the Affordable Care Act will jack up prices in the market for individuals seeking coverage.</p>
<p>Before the replacement bill was introduced, inewsource found that <a href="http://inewsource.org/2017/02/16/obamacare-repeal-mean-370000-san-diego-lose-insurance/"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >370,000 people</a> in the county were in danger of losing health insurance if the Affordable Care Act was repealed without a replacement.</p>
<h2>State News Roundup: L.A. Rejects Anti-Growth Measure</h2>
<p>• L.A voters turned out in non-droves and <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-election-analysis-20170308-story.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >defeated a landmark measure</a> that would have clamped down hard on growth and the high-density dreams of urbanists. &#8220;Much of L.A.’s establishment — politicians, labor unions, business groups — opposed Measure S, and cheered its defeat,&#8221; the LA Times reports.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, L.A. County voters <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-measure-h-20170308-story.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >approved a measure</a> that will boost sales taxes to combat homelessness. &#8220;Advertising for the measure promised it would move an estimated 45,000 homeless families and individuals into permanent housing during the first five years, while preventing 30,000 more families and individuals from becoming homeless,&#8221; the Times reports.</p>
<p>• For many of us, the Grapevine just refers to that long mountainous stretch of I-5 north of L.A. that boils over car radiators (don&#8217;t ask me how I know this) and gets funky when the northbound and southbound lanes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_5_in_California"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >reverse their positions</a>. But there&#8217;s more to the Grapevine than a road: An <a href="http://www.scvhistory.com/scvhistory/hw022157.htm"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >earthquake</a> estimated at magnitude 7.9 struck to the north in 1857 and damaged Fort Tejon; it was felt from north of Sacramento to San Diego, where it caused &#8220;great consternation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, a new report says <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-earthquake-san-andreas-grapevine-20170307-story.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >a new major quake is coming</a>. It&#8217;s overdue, might last for two minutes, and &#8220;could damage aqueducts that ferry water into Southern California from the north, disrupt electric transmission lines and tear up Interstate 5.&#8221; Of course, there would be damage in L.A. and perhaps here too.</p>
<p>&#8220;There’s no getting out of this,” an expert says, although it could still be decades before we get smacked again.</p>
<p>• &#8220;Some 700,000 Californians are currently <a href="http://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/Thousands-of-Californians-Have-Contaminated-Water-Coming-From-Taps-415630723.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" > being exposed to contaminated water at home or at school</a>, according to the latest data from California’s Water Resources Control Board,&#8221; NBC reports, and &#8220;more than 3,000 of those residents are living in the San Diego region, often in poorer, rural communities located within areas of Potrero, Pauma Valley and Borrego Springs.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Our Own Tom Waits and a Lesson in Life</h2>
<p>The NY Times talks to Chula Vista native and rock icon Tom Waits about his art and hears a nice story about how he worked in the backcountry town of Jacumba as a firefighter in the late 1960s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/01/t-magazine/beck-tom-waits-kendrick-lamar.html?_r=0"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >when a call came in</a>. He&#8217;d been trained, but not quite for this.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was late and all of a sudden the aroma of fried chicken envelops our truck and we begin to slow and there it is, roaring and crackling: a chicken ranch on fire,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The old farmer couple, Mom and Pop, are holding each other in silhouette as their world burns. &#8230; The captain says: ‘WAITS!!! Take that hose and start putting out some of these chickens.’ So there I am aiming at these flying, screaming, burning chickens, and I had never seen a chicken fly before, but boy can they fly.&#8221;</p>
<p>This story has greater meaning. &#8220;It was an emergency, and when dealing with emergent behavior there is nothing to do but respond,&#8221; he told the paper. &#8220;I was in the moment. And it was not the fire I imagined or dreamed of. It was the fire I got.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Quick News Hits: Relaxasaurus Rex</h2>
<p><strong>•  </strong>Jimmy Dore, a comedian and very liberal national talk show host <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9KyR86CZ1E" data-rel="lightbox-video-0">went after local Rep.

They&#8217;re doing it in Omaha, the NY Times reports. Nobody likes it, but cities are getting creative to deal with decay: &#8220;In Youngstown, Ohio, officials closed off some uninhabited streets. In Gary, Ind., some of the city’s parks could close — a process city officials call “renaturing” — after years of neglect. And in one Michigan county, a deteriorating bridge was torn down, not replaced.&#8221;</p>

<p>Turns out &#8220;the dogs in the class were often so present and relaxed,&#8221; KPBS reports, &#8220;that they spent much of the time slowly drifting off to sleep.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The assumption behind the Trump Administration&#8217;s push for a border wall is that it&#8217;s needed to keep immigrants from coming here illegally. But what if it isn&#8217;t?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/news/immigration-mexico-soon-plummet-even-without-border-wall/"  target="_blank">That&#8217;s the contention</a> of two UC San Diego economists. &#8220;In fact, there is good reason to expect that the flow of immigration from Mexico is about to drop sharply — wall or no wall,&#8221; writes VOSD contributor Kyle D. Navis, a grad student. &#8220;Indeed, while it might seem like large volumes of Mexican immigration are a foregone conclusion, the flow has not always been as large, and is expected to fall sharply in the near future, as presaged by the declining rate of border crossings since 2007.&#8221;</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s a hitch: Trump is very skeptical of free trade pacts, and his efforts to build up American industry at the expense of other countries could hurt Mexico, which might drive more immigration.</p>
<h2>Minimum Wage Hike = YMCA Rate Hike</h2>
<p>All members of the YMCA in the county will see <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/business/san-diego-ymca-will-raise-rates-in-response-to-the-minimum-wage-increase/"  target="_blank">a slight hike in monthly rates</a> because a new minimum wage law is forcing the organization to pay its employees more, our Adriana Heldiz reports.</p>
<p>The YMCA is a significant local employer. Last year, it had 896 full-time workers and another 4,206 who work part-time.</p>
<h2>Schools Chief: Cut or Else, Even if Money Comes</h2>
<p>Cindy Marten, the superintendent of San Diego Unified, told the U-T editorial board that &#8220;even if the state provides more money than now expected, the district should <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/education/sd-me-unified-layoffs-20170307-story.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >stick with the number of job reductions it now is considering</a> to create what she called a structural, long-term solution to balancing the budget,&#8221; the paper reported.</p>
<p>Marten said layoffs could lead to almost 1,400 employees losing their full or part-time jobs with the district. Last week, <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/education/three-big-outstanding-questions-san-diego-unifieds-budget-cuts/"  target="_blank">we estimated</a> that 1,500 full-time equivalent jobs would be slashed to make up a budget shortfall of $124 million.</p>
<h2>In L.A., a Showdown Over Growth</h2>
<p>Los Angeles voters — well, at least the few expected to bother to cast a ballot — were to decide the fate of development in that city yesterday. Measure S <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-la-vision-20170303-story.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >called for a two-year halt in projects requiring City Council approval.</a></p>
<p>The L.A. Times explains: &#8220;Organized to stop the &#8216;reckless approval of outsized development practices,&#8217; the Measure S campaign has identified more than 50 projects from West Hills to Boyle Heights, pinning them with labels such as &#8216;instant ghetto,&#8217; &#8216;vulgar stucco pile&#8217; and &#8216;black-lung lofts.'&#8221; Meanwhile, the measure&#8217;s &#8220;opponents take a familiar line: Stalling development will kill jobs, exacerbate the housing shortage and drive up rents.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I&#8217;m naming my new band Vulgar Stucco Pile.</p>
<h2>Hello, 12,000 Legislators?</h2>
<p>A Rancho Santa Fe businessman named John Cox is <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article136953898.html?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >running for governor</a> as a Republican and seems to have money to burn with $1 million in a campaign exploratory committee, The Sacramento Bee reports.</p>
<p>In 2012, the U-T reported, he pushed for a plan to <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/politics/sdut-local-businessman-seeks-overhaul-of-legislature-2012mar05-story.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >greatly increase the size of the state legislature</a> to &#8220;roughly 12,000 representatives elected at the neighborhood level, who then select 120 members of a &#8216;working committee&#8217; to go to Sacramento&#8230; Final bill approval would come from the broader group, working from home, casting up-or-down votes on a secured computer network.&#8221;</p>
<p>• &#8220;California will no longer keep death row inmates in solitary confinement for years <a href="http://www.kpbs.org/news/2017/mar/07/california-eases-conditions-death-row-disciplinary/"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >only because of their purported gang affiliations</a>, according to a lawsuit settlement announced Monday,&#8221; the AP reports.</p>
<p>But the windowless solitary confinement unit will remain, with inmates allowed to kept there for up to 5 years. One inmate reportedly had been in solitary confinement for more than a quarter-century.</p>
<h2>Culturecast: Inside Balboa Park&#8217;s &#8216;Fruit Loop&#8217;</h2>
<p>A public art series called Parkeology is chronicling tales of Balboa Park, and its latest project focuses on memories of the Fruit Loop, a hot spot for gay cruising and illicit (and anonymous) sexual activity on the park&#8217;s southwestern edge. The road even goes one way instead of two because officials wanted to prevent car-to-car flirtation.</p>
<p>VOSD&#8217;s Culturecast podcast dropped by to hear audio memories played in cars at Marston Point. You can listen to the podcast by our arts editor Kinsee Morlan <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/arts/culturecast-revisiting-balboa-parks-fruit-loop/"  target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;You could think of that era of cruising as a negative but the fact of the matter is, people were coming here because it was a time when being gay was illegal,” says one of the artists. “I think this history is actually really important because it speaks a lot about an era and the way people socialized and connected.”</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> San Diego has a fascinating secret gay history, as I explored in <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/all-narratives/sd-pride-category/fairy-dives-stings-and-arrests-inside-s-d-s-forgotten-gay-past5-facts-about-our-lgbt-history/"  target="_blank">a VOSD story</a> published during last year&#8217;s gay pride celebration. We were home to gay bars as early as World War II, while police raids and gay-baiting investigations weren&#8217;t uncommon.</p>
<p>In his obscure song &#8220;<a href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/brucespringsteen/balboapark.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >Balboa Park</a>,&#8221; Bruce Springsteen chronicled the lives of Latino hustlers who came to the park looking for action, &#8220;where the men in their Mercedes/Come nightly to employ/In the cool San Diego evening/ The services of the border boys.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Culture Report: Making It Easier for Arts to Get Money</h2>
<p>This week&#8217;s <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/arts/culture-report-20/"  target="_blank">Culture Report</a> leads off with an effort to make it easier for arts organizations to apply for chunks of money from proceeds from a city tax on hotel guests. The idea is to make the process less intimidating and get the word out so more groups can apply for money.</p>
<p>Also in the Culture Report: A racy opera, Chicana identity, and a March 16 VOSD event about San Diego&#8217;s craft coffee boom (which is <a href="https://www.projectnosh.com/food-wire/2017/bird-rock-coffee-roasters-plans-expansion-new-owner/"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >continuing to, um, percolate</a>). And, oh good gracious, <a href="http://www.sandiegomagazine.com/Blogs/SD-Food-News/Winter-2017/You-Cant-Be-Trusted-With-Salt-and-Pepper-and-Heres-Why/"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >bossy local restaurants aren&#8217;t trusting diners with salt and pepper</a>.</p>
<h2>Quick News Hits: Will the Border Wall Do Windows?</h2>
<p><strong>•</strong> There&#8217;s <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/environment/sd-me-spill-newestimate-20170306-story.html#nt=oft02a-1li3"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >confusion and uncertainty</a> over exactly how big the Tijuana sewage spill was last week. Meanwhile, there&#8217;s video evidence that <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/opinion/the-conversation/sd-video-tijuana-mexico-sewage-spill-san-diego-california-20170306-htmlstory.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >the spill continued after officials said it was over</a>. (U-T)</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> The former Union-Tribune complex in Mission Valley, once home to a newsroom, printing presses and an eccentric publisher&#8217;s <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/news/city-not-sure-u-t-car-museum-is-street-legal/"  target="_blank">historic car museum</a>, will become a &#8220;<a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/business/growth-development/sd-fi-ampersand-20170306-story.html"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >330,000-square-foot creative office center</a>,&#8221; the U-T reports. (The paper is now based downtown.)</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> The $25 million Trump University class-action suit, centered in a San Diego federal court, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/06/autossell/trump-university-class-action-lawsuit-settlement.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=a-lede-package-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=0"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >may not be finished after all</a>. (NY Times)</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> Parts of the Trump border wall could be &#8220;<a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/trump-border-wall-mick-mulvaney-235716"  target="_blank"  target="_blank" >see-through</a>,&#8221; a national budget official declared this week, although there doesn&#8217;t seem to be any information about whether that means it&#8217;ll be like a fence or have windows.</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s the latter, sounds like a good time to buy stock in Windex.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not long after she began as superintendent of San Diego Unified, Cindy Marten created the Quality Assurance Office.</p>
<p>The thinking was that the new office could be an accountability hub where parents and district staffers could have complaints thoroughly investigated if they believed they’d been treated unfairly.</p>
<p>But how that office operates and its effectiveness is being called into question, documents from a lawsuit against the district reveal.</p>
<p>The lawsuit stems from a salacious case at Green Elementary School. But the details from the lawsuit <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/education/documents-raise-major-questions-about-school-districts-quality-assurance-office/" >go beyond just that uncomfortable case and shed light on some troubling issues</a>, Ashly McGlone writes in a new story.</p>
<p>The Quality Assurance Office was dealing with a complaint at Green Elementary in 2014, “but according to their own testimony, Marten and Donovan made two important decisions without crucial facts.” Marten, for example, decided to let the principal at Green keep his job before the office’s investigation into possible wrongdoing was complete. Donovan quickly determined that the incident wasn’t a sexual harassment case – without looking at the district’s sexual harassment policy.</p>
<p>McGlone pulls out more details and quotes offered in the case that raise questions about whether district officials are following state and federal rules, and their own policies.</p>
<h2>San Diego NIMBYs Aren&#8217;t Who You&#8217;d Expect</h2>
<p>Often it’s liberals who don&#8217;t want new development — they might oppose the environmental impacts, or question developers&#8217; intentions or both.</p>
<p>But polling from last year’s District 3 race for county supervisor shows that dynamic might be a little topsy-turvy in San Diego.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/land-use/in-san-diego-anti-growth-sentiment-comes-from-the-right/" >Voters in that district proved to be anti-development – especially Republican voters</a>.</p>
<p>Polling from Competitive Edge Research “found that roughly twice as many conservatives in the district explicitly identified as anti-growth than liberals. Seventeen percent of liberals said slowing down residential development was very or extremely important to them, versus 38 percent of conservatives,” writes Maya Srikrishnan.</p>
<p>Republican consultant Jason Roe offered a theory in an appearance on the VOSD podcast: It’s not necessarily party affiliation that’s driving these decisions, but whether a voter owns his or her home.</p>
<p>“The only thing I can come up with is: They got their house, they don’t want their neighborhoods crowded up, they don’t want all these people coming in and choking up their roads and their schools,” Roe said.</p>
<p><strong>• </strong>Speaking of anti-growth sentiment, Liam Dillon writes that in order for California to meet its ambitious climate goals, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-housing-climate-change-goals-20170306-story.html"  target="_blank"  >California will have to build waaaaaaaaaaaay more housing</a>, and it should be dense and near transit. In other words, probably not gonna happen. This should sound familiar:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Even now, the effort to<strong> </strong>shift development from suburban to urban areas is facing strong head winds. Across California, local resistance and an existing state environmental law that prioritizes car travel over mass transit have frustrated attempts to plan and build housing that will help the state meet its climate goals.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Dillon notes in his story a dynamic that <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/government/one-term-in-faulconer-hasnt-moved-the-needle-much-on-new-housing/" >Andy Keatts pointed out in January</a>: San Diego had a chance to make neighborhoods like Golden Hill, Uptown and North Park more dense during recent community plan update, but passed.</p>
<p>“If San Diego neighborhoods most primed for heavy development don’t achieve the goals, it’s unlikely the rest of the city will pick up the slack,” climate activist Nicole Capretz told Dillon.</p>
<h2>The Day in Border Politics</h2>
<p>The director of the Office of Management and Budget said on Monday that <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/trump-border-wall-mick-mulvaney-235716"  target="_blank"  >there’s a desire for parts of President Donald Trump’s border wall to be “see-through,</a>” according to Politico.</p>
<p>The wall might be made of concrete in certain portions, Mick Mulvaney told a conservative radio host, “In other places, the border folks are actually telling us, border control&#8217;s actually telling us that they like the one you can see through, because it reduces the number of violent attacks on our folks. So it&#8217;s a complicated program.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, county sheriffs from around the state joined Republican lawmakers at a press conference <a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-california-sheriffs-say-sanctuary-1488828617-htmlstory.html"  target="_blank"  >condemning a bill</a> that would prevent local law enforcement agencies from expending resources on immigration enforcement. The state bill, SB 54, is being called a “sanctuary state” law for shorthand.</p>
<p>San Diego state Sen. Joel Anderson is <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/government/sacramento-report-anderson-becomes-leading-anti-sanctuary-voice/" >one of the leading voices against the bill</a>.</p>
<p>He said at the press conference that the law would hinder federal officials from deporting “rapists and child molesters,&#8221; according to the L.A. Times.</p>
<p>Remember, though, that <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/border/neither-san-diego-nor-california-is-a-sanctuary-for-the-undocumented/" >most promises of “sanctuary” from state and local leaders ring a bit hollow</a>.</p>
