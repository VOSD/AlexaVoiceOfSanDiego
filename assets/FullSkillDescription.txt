Launched in 2005, Voice of San Diego was the first digital nonprofit news organization to serve a local community in the country. Its founders, longtime columnist and editor Neil Morgan and entrepreneur Buzz Woolley, felt the region desperately needed more reporting, analysis and journalistic competition.

Voice of San Diego made a name for itself by producing hard-hitting investigative reports along with civic engagement opportunities that gave San Diego residents a new platform to discuss and debate the issues that impact their quality of life.

Fast forward a decade and Voice of San Diego is widely regarded as a pioneer in the nonprofit news industry that has built a sustainable business model based on the support of individual members, sponsors and the investment of local and national foundations.
